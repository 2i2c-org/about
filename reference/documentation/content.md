# Write content with MyST markdown

Our documentation is written in [MyST Markdown](https://myst.tools), using a parser for Sphinx developed by the [Executable Books project](https://executablebooks.org).

## MyST Markdown overview

The quickest way to learn how to write with MyST Markdown is to [read the MyST Markdown overview](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/content/myst.html).

## MyST Markdown cheat-sheet

For a reference of many kinds of MyST Markdown, see [the MyST Markdown cheat-sheet](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/reference/cheatsheet.html).
This shows many common types of content people write, and how they look with MyST source code.

## Interactive MyST explorer

See [the MyST-JS documentation](https://myst.tools/docs/mystjs/typography) has live examples of MyST Markdown that you can edit to see their output.
This is another useful reference and a way to quickly play around with different formats.

:::{warning}
Some of the syntax in MyST-JS is slightly different from MyST-Python - the project is working to unify these experiences.

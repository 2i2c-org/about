# Communication strategy

There are many ways to communicate with the outside world, and we have limited resources to devote towards communication.
As such, we focus our efforts around **blog-style posts**, with signal boosting via **Twitter** and **Mailing Lists**.

## Goals in communications

* **Provide transparency.** Show what our organization is up to, what we are learning, why we make certain decisions, how major projects are advancing, etc.
* **Demonstrate impact.** Highlight the impact that our work (via development, services, etc) has on other communities, and how it feeds into our mission.
* **Highlight services and features.** Draw attention to features or workflows that are particularly useful for communities we serve.
* **Grow our reputation for expertise.** Make it clear that we know what we are talking about, and are making valuable contributions across the stack.
* **Grow our reputation with open source.** Demonstrate how we are being a good citizen in the open source communities we work with.
* **Signal-boost others.** We should use our communication as a way of highlighting other people and efforts, both within and outside of 2i2c.
* **Do not claim undue credit for 2i2c.** When working in collaboration with others in open source projects, highlight 2i2c as a “collaborator and member” of open source projects, not the sole creator.
* **Provide calls to action.** If there is an action we’d like others to take (e.g., potential customers, or stakeholders of 2i2c) we should communicate this (e.g., via our mailing lists).

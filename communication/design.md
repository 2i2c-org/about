# Design and images

There are several design and images assets that we use in our websites and online materials.
For example, logos, banners, images for GitHub Teams, etc.

## Figma board

Almost all of our design assets [exist in this Figma board](https://www.figma.com/file/EYFRCag2gfYGdEZGFrXgzv/2i2c-Logos?node-id=0%3A1&t=0C2Sudf1pYmaY3Xr-0).
Any team member should be able to access it and re-use assets as you wish.
Feel free to make edits to the board as-needed.

## Google Drive

We store some assets on Google Drive, such as diagrams that we use in our documentation.
Much of this is [in the `Outreach and Marketing/Media` folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1YJVBCXFYHXo-xcfHo63WdinnNRETisE2?usp=share_link).

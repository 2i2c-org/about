# Testimonials

We collect testimonials from communities so that we can champion our collaborations with them in our various channels, e.g. blog posts, presentations and talks.

This is collected via email at [partnerships@2i2c.org](mailto:partnerships@2i2c.org) and will automatically generate a FreshDesk ticket. 

Once the testimonial is received, please store them for future use in our *[2i2c Team Drive > Communication and Outreach > Testimonials](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19m4Gr40A1vR-f3qDy9fClqumQRp5zqcK?usp=drive_link)* folder, along with the date received and the FreshDesk ticket number.

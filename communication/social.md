# Social media

We use social media to signal boost and broadcast 2i2c's impact to the broader community.

## Social media accounts

Currently, we do not have a dedicated Social Media manager, so if you'd like access to one of these accounts ask the Executive Director and they can give you access.

- **Twitter**: Our Twitter handle is ([@2i2c_org](https://twitter.com/2i2c_org)) for .
  Currently, there is nobody activately monitoring the Twitter account.
  We use it to post links to blog posts or major announcements in the newsletter.
  Many team members also use Twitter, so feel free to `@`-mention `@2i2c_org` if you wish!
- **LinkedIn**: Here is [our LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/company/70495902/admin/).
  We use LinkedIn roughly the same way that we use Twitter, though focus it more on signal-boosting blog posts and updates because fewer team members regularly use LinkedIn.

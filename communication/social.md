# Social media

We use social media to signal boost and broadcast 2i2c's impact to the broader community.

## Social media accounts

Currently, we do not have a dedicated Social Media manager, so the responsibility for managing these accounts is spread amongst the team.

### Twitter

Our Twitter handle is ([@2i2c_org](https://twitter.com/2i2c_org)).
Currently, there is nobody activately monitoring the Twitter account.
We use it to post links to blog posts or major announcements in the newsletter.
Many team members also use Twitter, so feel free to `@`-mention `@2i2c_org` if you wish!

**How to access**: We access this account via a shared `username`/`password`.
If you'd like access, ask the {role}`Executive Director` or somebody else with access.
It is possible to have [multi-user access to Twitter accounts via TweetDeck](https://twitter.com/settings/teams) but we have not yet set this up.

### LinkedIn

Here is [our LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/company/70495902/).
We use LinkedIn roughly the same way that we use Twitter, though focus it more on signal-boosting blog posts and updates because fewer team members regularly use LinkedIn.

**How to access**: We can add **page admins** to our LinkedIn account, which gives others the ability to manage the account and post content.
If you'd like to be added, ask one of [the pre-existing account admins](https://www.linkedin.com/company/70495902/admin/manage-admins/).

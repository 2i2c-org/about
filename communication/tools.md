# Tools

Here is a list of tools that help with our marketing and outreach activities.

## Buffer

This is a productivity tool for posting across our X/Twitter, Mastodon and LinkedIn channels simultaneously and scheduling social media campaigns with a content calendar.

How to access: See [](account:bitwarden).

## Plausible

[Plausible](https://plausible.io/2i2c.org) is a more ethical alternative to Google Analytics. It is used to analyse traffic to our website. This is a yearly subscription service and the bill date occurs on Aug 14.

How to access: See [](account:bitwarden).

## `screen.studio` licenses for screencasts

The [`screen.studio`](https://screen.studio) tool is useful for recording high-quality screencasts of demonstrations.
It is used to create movies and GIFs like the ones we share on [2i2c.org/platform](https://2i2c.org/platform).

We have **three device slots for `screen.studio`**, and a single activation key that activates a device for one of the slots.
A list of active slots and the key for adding a new device is in [our team BitWarden account](#account:bitwarden).

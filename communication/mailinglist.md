# Mailing list

We use [Mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com/) to send e-mails to individuals that have signed up for 2i2c's mailing list.

This is a more attentive and personal audience than our blog, so we use the mailing list to **signal boost particularly important information**, or to **ask others to signal-boost for us**.

## How to access Mailchimp

We have a single Mailchimp account and share access to team members via a single `username`/`password`.
The {role}`Executive Director` is responsible for this information, though others on the team may have it as well.
If you'd like access, ask the ED or one of the team members with this information.

## What to share with our mailing list

Here are a few ideas for major topics to share with our mailing lists:

## Things to post in our mailing list

- **Major community updates**. Our quarterly / annual community updates that summarize our major progress and challenges.
- **Job postings**. When we post a new job, share it with our mailing list and ask them to share it with their networks.
- **Major blog posts**. If we write a blog post about our service that is particularly impactful or important, we can post it to our mailing list for extra visibility.

## Send e-mails via Mailchimp

Mailchimp is a little complex for our needs, as it is a full community management and communications service.
However, it is still the simplest solution out there so here's a quick guide on how to use it.

Mailchimp calls each e-mail a **Campaign**.

**To see our preview e-mails**: Click {guilabel}`Campaigns` -> {guilabel}`All campaigns`. You'll see a list of the previous e-mails we've sent to our communities via Mailchimp.

**To create a new e-mail**: The simplest approach is to **replicate a previous campaign**. Go to the list of previous campaigns (see above), click the `v` next to the latest one, and click on {guilabel}`Replicate`. This will give you a pre-filled template with the same layout we've used before. Replace the content as you wish before sending.

Send new campaigns as your personal e-mail address (if you wish to identify personally with the e-mail), or with `hello@2i2c.org`.

## Our contact list

Users sign up to the newsletter via our landing page's contact form at [2i2c.org#contact](https://2i2c.org#contact).
Email addresses are imported into Mailchimp for the newsletter.
**Do not manually add e-mail addresses** unless you know somebody wants to be on this list.

To see our contact list in Mailchimp, go to {guilabel}`Audience` -> {guilabel}`All contacts`.
You'll see a list of names and e-mail addresses that have signed up for our Mailing list.

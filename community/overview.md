# Scope and responsibilities

Our community guidance area ensures that 2i2c's partner communities have the guidance and skills to have impact via our infrastructure and services, and that they can share these skills without being dependent on 2i2c.
It oversees our content creation and training efforts for partner communities.
It also oversees our systems for communication and interaction with partner communities.

We are still understanding how this area fits in with 2i2c, and the responsibilities and structure of this area may change.

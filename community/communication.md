# External communication channels

There are a few different ways that we communicate with stakeholders outside of 2i2c.
See below for details.

## Blog

Our most common form of communication is via [the blog at 2i2c.org/blog](https://2i2c.org/blog).
It is managed by our [Hugo website repository](https://github.com/2i2c-org/2i2c-org.github.io).

## Social media

We have a Twitter acccount ([@2i2c_org](https://twitter.com/2i2c_org)) for social media communication.
Currently, there is nobody activately monitoring the Twitter account.
We use it to post links to blog posts or major announcements in the newsletter.

## Newsletter

- Newsletter: [using Mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com/)
  - Users sign up to the newsletter via our landing page's contact form at [2i2c.org#contact](https://2i2c.org#contact). Email addresses are imported into Mailchimp for the newsletter.

## Zenodo community

We have [a Zenodo community](https://zenodo.org/communities/2i2c/) that we use to upload and categorize any artifacts that warrant a DOI.
Any 2i2c team member is welcome to add their Zenodo records to this community, and any team member may be added to the list of curators.

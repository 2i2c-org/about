# External communication channels

There are a few different ways that we communicate with stakeholders outside of 2i2c.
See below for details.

There are three main ways that 2i2c communicates with the outside world:

- Twitter: [@2i2c_org](https://twitter.com/2i2c_org)
  - Currently, there is nobody activately monitoring the Twitter account. We use it to post links to blog posts or major announcements in the newsletter.
- Newsletter: [using Mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com/)
  - Users sign up to the newsletter via our landing page's contact form at [2i2c.org#contact](https://2i2c.org#contact). Email addresses are imported into Mailchimp for the newsletter.
- Blog: [2i2c.org/blog](https://2i2c.org/blog)
  - The blog is managed by our [Hugo website repository](https://github.com/2i2c-org/2i2c-org.github.io). All new posts are automatically sent to the mailing list on a weekly basis.

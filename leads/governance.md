# Making decisions

Functional areas and their team leads follow our [Principles of decision making](../organization/governance.md).
This section describes more specific ways in which decisions usually happen.

## How team leads make decisions

Team leads often make decisions that impact the entire organization.
Decisions usually begin with a proposal in the form of a Google Doc or a GitHub issue, and discussion around that proposal tends to happen asynchronously or in our [Organizational strategy meeting](leads:meeting:organizational-strategy).

This group strives for consensus before moving forward, thought makes decisions [on a consent-based process](governance:consent).
If we are at an impasse and must nonetheless move forward, the {role}`Executive Director` may break ties.

## How teams make decisions

Most teams follow a similar decision-making process to the one described for team leads, though often with less formal structure around the process, or modified structure that adapts to their workflow.
We try to let teams [define the decision-making structure that works for them](governance:decide-near-action).
For example, [here's the engineering team's Pull Request process](development:merge-policy).

If decisions within a team are at an impasse, then a team lead can make a decision in order to move forward.

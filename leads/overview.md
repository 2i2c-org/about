# Scope and responsibilities

The Team Leads is a bit different than most other 2i2c teams.
It has a cross-organizational scope and focuses on high-level priorities, strategy, and ensures we are distributing attention and resources across the organization correctly.

Team leads are representatives of their respective areas in 2i2c.
They advocate for the goals and needs of those areas.
They also bridge and coordinate strategy, prioritization, and resources across 2i2c.

## Responsibilities

Our team leads is responsible for sharing and coordinating information across the organization.
Here are some major responsibilities:

- Hold one another accountable for understanding our mission, embodying our values, and following best-practices for distributed teamwork.
- Define the strategy for 2i2c and our major objectives for accomplishing that strategy.
- Define the priorities in each functional area so that they are coherent and feed into our organization's goals.
- Practice healthy delegation of responsibility to achieve these priorities.
- Ensure that those with responsibility have the resources and authority needed to be held accountable.
- Hold one another accountable for accomplishing our priorities.

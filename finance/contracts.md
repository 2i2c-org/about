# Contracts and invoices

We have a contract to define our formal relationship with any external organizations or people.
We use invoices to exchange funds (incoming and outgoing) those with which we have a contract.
This section describes where you can information about our active and past contracts and invoices.

## Contracts

{term}`CS&S` tracks all of our contracts in an [AirTable](accounts:airtable).
We synchronize this AirTable to our own in the link below, and generate [dashboards to summarize important data](contracts:dashboards).

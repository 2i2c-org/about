# Finance and accounting

Main documentation for 2i2c's financial and accounting information.

:::{admonition} A note on access
All 2i2c-specific accounting documents should be accessible on our Team Drive to anybody with a `@2i2c.org` address.
We don't control the access conditions for the CS&S documents described below, so if you don't have access to these, ask the Executive Director.
:::

We split our financial and accounting data between two places:

[2i2c Drive Folder with our finance assets](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1D5NQKhPDP6zMQ8EdLcMOceTz-ek81nmX?usp=sharing) contains 2i2c-specific budgeting and modeling information. It is available to all team members.

[CS&S Drive Folder with their finance assets](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/115EIa6cD4BNGIqOd2i7Rqu3MgsM73lgR?usp=sharing) contains assets that are stewarded by CS&S. It is available to 2i2c'c executive director.

See these subsections for more information about accounting and finance.

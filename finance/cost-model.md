# Our cost model

There are a variety of activities that we take on as a part of our mission.
Some of these are easily tied directly to a grant or service charge, but others are important but non-obvious.
This section highlights the most important sources of costs for us, so that we are transparent and realistic about defining our costs to others.

## Direct costs

These are the most obvious costs that are tied directly to our Managed JupyterHub Service.
We break them into three categories:

1. Operating the cloud infrastructure
2. Maintaining and improving the cloud infrastructure
3. Providing support and community guidance

## Impact costs



1. **Upstream costs**: The extra cost we incur by doing our work with upstream communities as well as supporting those communities throughout our work.
2. **Service subsidization costs**: Allow us to subsidize the cost for other communities we work with that cannot pay our full costs.

## Indirect costs

1. **Improvement costs**: Investments into our infrastructure and systems, to create better and more reliable cloud services.
2. **Buffer costs**: Allows us to grow without financial strain, and allows us to withstand financial hardship.
3. **Research and development costs**: Allow us to create and improve things in new ways to support new workflows.
4. Leadership and administration costs

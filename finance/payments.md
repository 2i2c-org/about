# Payment accounts

There are a few ways that we can pay for things.
This section describes them.

## Credit cards

We have two Ramp credit cards.

**Chris Holdgraf** has the credit card information for these cards.
Ask him if you need to use them.

See [](admin:reimbursement) for our reimbursement processes.

### General purpose card

Ends in `4164`.

This is used for most purchases by 2i2c, including recurring service payments, travel payments on behalf of team members, etc.

### Cloud credits card

Ends in `7770`.

Used only for paying cloud providers (GCP, AWS, and Azure) for cloud costs.
We generally intend to re-imburse ourselves via invoices to communities for any cost charged to this credit card.

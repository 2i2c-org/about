# Payment accounts

There are a few ways that we can pay for things.

## Credit cards

We have two Ramp credit cards:

- one that is designed specifically to reimburse cloud costs
- another that is for general purposes.

We pay for the majority of our organizational expenses via one of these processes.
See [](admin:reimbursement) for our reimbursement processes.

**Chris Holdgraf** has the credit card information for these cards.
Ask him if you need to use them.

# Budget projections

Our budget projection model begins with a source of truth about our **current and historical costs and revenue**, and then projects into the future by making assumptions about these numbers.
It allows us to manually specify costs and revenue in the future, if we **know** that they will happen.
It also lets us specify repeating numbers each month, and a percentage growth rate for monthly recurring revenues.

It is stored as a Google Sheet at the following link:

## Update our budget projections model

The model can be updated to begin on a new date, and to reflect the latest data for our "Cash on Hand".
It then updates its projections based on our Income and Expenses assumptions.

To update this model with the latest information, [follow the instructions in the first tab the model](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zDO_kqnJ1PH3GWOMks5E_1oIpoAJgseWhj3oCohUVZk/edit#gid=929955044).


## Burn rate

We can use the budget projections model to calculate our Burn Rate (how quickly we are losing/gaining money, and when we will reach `$0`.)
To do so follow these steps:

- Go to [our budget projections sheet](accounting:projections).
- Look at the `Summary` tab.
- This shows our burn rate, along with 9 and 24 month cutoffs.

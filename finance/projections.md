# Budget projections

Our budget projection model begins with a source of truth about our **current and historical costs and revenue**, and then projects into the future by making assumptions about these numbers.
It allows us to manually specify costs and revenue in the future, if we **know** that they will happen.
It also lets us specify repeating numbers each month, and a percentage growth rate for monthly recurring revenues.

```{admonition} Feel free to edit and experiment
The projections sheet is a **tool** to be used to understand how our hiring and cost decisions will affect our finances moving forward.
Feel free to experiment with adding new line items to help guide decision-making about our costs.
```

It is stored as a Google Sheet at the following link:

## Update our budget projections model

The model can be updated to begin on a new date, and to reflect the latest data for our "Cash on Hand".
It then updates its projections based on our Income and Expenses assumptions.

To update this model with the latest information, [follow the instructions in the first tab the model](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zDO_kqnJ1PH3GWOMks5E_1oIpoAJgseWhj3oCohUVZk/edit#gid=929955044).


## Burn rate

We can use the budget projections model to calculate our Burn Rate (how quickly we are losing/gaining money, and when we will reach `$0`.)
To do so follow these steps:

- Go to [our budget projections sheet](accounting:projections).
- Look at the `Summary` tab.
- This shows our burn rate, along with 9 and 24 month cutoffs.

## Tracking our contracts portfolio

Our monthly process for tracking our contracts portfolio will require input from CS&S, the Delivery Manager and the Partnership Lead. Both the Delivery Manager and Partnership Lead need to cultivate an ongoing understanding of the portfolio to:

- Be able to update it as a source of truth
- Identify accounting or contractual deviations.

### Delivery Manager's responsibilities

The Delivery Manager will be responsible for monitoring the systems that we have for tracking contracts in collaboration with the CS&S team. Accounting deviations or concerns will be reported the the Partnership Lead. Additionally, it'll be the responsibility of the Delivery Manager to refine the process over time.

### Partnership Lead's responsibilities

The Partnership Lead will be responsible for taking actions to follow up with communities and/or triggering processes in CS&S to move actions forward. They will be expect to work closesly with the Delivery Manager to ensure the system is working effectively.

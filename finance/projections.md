# Budget projections

Our budget projection model begins with a source of truth about our **current and historical costs and revenue**, and then projects into the future by making assumptions about these numbers.
It allows us to manually specify costs and revenue in the future, if we **know** that they will happen.
It also lets us specify repeating numbers each month, and a percentage growth rate for monthly recurring revenues.

```{admonition} Feel free to edit and experiment
The projections sheet is a **tool** to be used to understand how our hiring and cost decisions will affect our finances moving forward.
Feel free to experiment with adding new line items to help guide decision-making about our costs.
```

It is stored as a Google Sheet at the following link:

## Update our budget projections model

The model can be updated to begin on a new date, and to reflect the latest data for our "Cash on Hand".
It then updates its projections based on our Income and Expenses assumptions.

To update this model with the latest information, [follow the instructions in the first tab the model](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zDO_kqnJ1PH3GWOMks5E_1oIpoAJgseWhj3oCohUVZk/edit#gid=929955044).

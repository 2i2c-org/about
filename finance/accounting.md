# Accounting data

Accounting data describes the money that we **know** we have spent or that we **highly expect** to receive.
There are a few kinds of accounting data we have access to:

All 2i2c-specific accounting documents should be accessible on our Team Drive to anybody with a `@2i2c.org` address.
We don't control the access conditions for the CS&S documents described below, so if you don't have access to these, ask the {role}`Executive Director`.

We split our financial and accounting data between two places:

- [2i2c Drive Folder with our finance assets](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1D5NQKhPDP6zMQ8EdLcMOceTz-ek81nmX?usp=sharing) contains 2i2c-specific budgeting and modeling information. It is available to all team members.

- [CS&S Drive Folder with their finance assets](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/115EIa6cD4BNGIqOd2i7Rqu3MgsM73lgR?usp=sharing) contains assets that are stewarded by CS&S. It is available to 2i2c'c executive director.

See these subsections below for more information about accounting data.

## All transactions

{term}`CS&S` provides us a monthly table of all our accounting transactions.
They are placed in the Shared CS&S Google Drive folder.
**The CS&S accounting tables are the source of truth for our revenue and costs.**
See [](accounting-statement-overview.md) for more information about these sheets.

We clean up and mirror these transactions in an [**Accounting Transactions AirTable**](https://airtable.com/appbjBTRIbgRiElkr/tblDKGQFU0iEIa5Qb/viwAdsIgMwbqKDdZ0).
We use this to create [our accounting dashboard](accounting:dashboard).
See [](../administration/airtable.md) for how to access AirTable.

## Accounting summary dashboard

We have a Sphinx page that summarizes important accounting information for us.
It is generated from the [CS&S accounting statements](accounting:statements) that we get monthly.
You can find this website at the following location:

# CoC Report Response Protocol

When a report is submitted through [the submission form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeKFuoghGzftqqgaa0xllZyocdUJsWZmoSaFFlerimg4n_Y8A/viewform?usp=sf_link), an email alert will be sent to the Executive Director of 2i2c.

Within two business days of receiving an email alert, the director will:

## Read the report to determine whether there has been a code of conduct violation

* If not, they will reply to the reporter, explain that our code of conduct was not violated, and suggest other remediation options (e.g. meeting to get advice on how to resolve an interpersonal conflict).
* If yes, the Director will determine whether they are the best person to respond to the situation, or if it is more appropriate to hand off the report to another Director or Steering Council member (for example, if someone else already has a relationship with the reporter or the accused).

## Follow up with the reporter

* We’ll email to acknowledge that we’ve received the report, and are taking action
* We’ll ask any follow-up questions we need to better understand the situation
* We’ll confirm that we can contact the accused individual

(coc:reporting:follow-up)=
## Follow up with the community member who violated our code of conduct

* We will reach out to the community member over email, let them know that we’ve received a report of a code of conduct violation, and invite them to speak to us about the incident in person if possible, over video chat if not.
* If the report was of abusive behavior, or the second report of unwelcoming behavior:
  * During our meeting we will tell the community member we’re removing them from the community, and disable their accounts.
* If the report was of unwelcoming behavior:
  * We will explain how their behavior violates our code of conduct, and what we expect of them moving forward.
  * We will warn them that a second code of conduct violation will result in them being removed from the 2i2c community.

If a Director or Steering Council member someone finds a report of a code of conduct violation somewhere other than our reporting form (e.g. on Slack, in an anonymous note, or in-person), that person will fill out the reporting form with all the information they can, and then follow the same protocol detailed above.

If a report is made anonymously without an email address provided for follow-up, or if the reporter indicates that they do not give us permission to act on their report, we will unfortunately not be able to take any action.

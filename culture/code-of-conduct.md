# Code of Conduct

## Why have a code of conduct?

Our goal is to create the best community in the world for learning, using, and creating open infrastructure for interactive computing.
We want every member of the 2i2c community to be able to focus their full attention on building amazing tools and developing a thriving culture of collaboration and inclusion around them.
This is impossible to do if you are being harassed, stalked, or discriminated against.

Accordingly, anyone that participates in a 2i2c space is expected to show respect and courtesy to each other in all interactions, whether in GitHub repositories, our Slack channel, in in-person events, when representing 2i2c in public, or in events and spaces associated with {term}`ICSI`.

To make sure that everyone has a common understanding of “show respect and courtesy to each other,” we have adopted the following code of conduct. The code of conduct is enforced by the 2i2c Executive Director and the Steering Council.

## Unacceptable behavior

The following types of behavior are unacceptable in 2i2c spaces, both online and in-person, and constitute code of conduct violations.

### Abusive behavior

Harassment
: including offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion, as well as sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual or romantic attention.

Threats
: threatening someone physically or verbally. For example, threatening to publicize sensitive information about someone’s personal life.

### Unwelcoming behavior


Blatant -isms
: saying things that are explicitly racist, sexist, homophobic, etc. For example, arguing that some people are less intelligent because of their gender, race or religion. {ref}`Subtle -isms <social:subtle-isms>` and small mistakes made in conversation are not code of conduct violations. However, repeating something after it has been pointed out to you that you broke a social rule, or antagonizing or arguing with someone who has pointed out your subtle -ism is considered unwelcoming behavior, and is not allowed at 2i2c.

Maliciousness towards other community members
: deliberately attempting to make others feel bad, name-calling, singling out others for derision or exclusion. For example, telling someone they’re not a real programmer or that they don’t belong at 2i2c.

Being especially unpleasant
: for example, if we’ve received reports from multiple 2i2c users, team members, or collaborators of annoying, rude, or especially distracting behavior.

## Scope

2i2c community members are held to the standards outlined in this code of conduct when interacting in the 2i2c Slack or GitHub repositories, when interacting in-person at events where they could represent 2i2c (this is most professional events), in physical spaces with other 2i2c team members or collaborators, or in any {term}`ICSI` space.

In addition, the 2i2c community and experience often extends outside those spaces—2i2c community members may go on walks together to get lunch, attend meetups or conferences as a group, communicate on social media, or interact with each other in other communities. Abusive or unwelcoming behavior between community members still has a profound impact on individuals and on the community when it happens beyond our walls. 2i2c Directors and the Steering Council will use our discretion when deciding whether to enforce this code of conduct and potentially remove someone from the 2i2c community after reports of such behavior happening outside of 2i2c, taking into account the impact on the individual community members involved as well as the impact on the community at large.

The 2i2c Code of Conduct does not apply to users of any hubs that we manage on behalf of other organizations, though we encourage leaders in those communities to adopt a Code of Conduct for their hub infrastructure. The Code of Conduct **does** apply to any 2i2c Team Member that is acting in a community's hub.

When in doubt, please {ref}`report <coc:reporting>` unacceptable behavior to us. If someone’s behavior outside of a 2i2c space makes you feel unsafe at 2i2c, that is absolutely relevant and actionable for us.


## Enforcement

We’ve categorized unacceptable behavior into abuse and unwelcoming behavior in the section above.

If we witness or receive a report about abusive behavior, we will contact the perpetrator to have a conversation with them and verify what has transpired, and they will be removed from the 2i2c community. Their Slack account will be deactivated, and permissions will be removed from any 2i2c-related repositories. They will not be welcome in any physical or digital spaces covered by the 2i2c Code of Conduct.

[This is the protocol](response-protocol.md) that 2i2c Directors and Steering Council members will use to respond to reports of code of conduct violations.

## Reporting

If you see a violation of our code of conduct, please [report it to the 2i2c Executive Director](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeKFuoghGzftqqgaa0xllZyocdUJsWZmoSaFFlerimg4n_Y8A/viewform?usp=sf_link).


### Why should I report?

* **You are responsible for making 2i2c a safe and comfortable space for everyone.** Everyone in our community shares this responsibility. 2i2c Team and Steering Council members are not around the online spaces or at 2i2c events all the time, so we cannot enforce the code of conduct without your help.
* **The consequences for the 2i2c community of not reporting bad behavior outweigh the consequences for one person of reporting it.** We sometimes hear “I don’t want X person to meet consequences because I told someone about their bad behavior.” Consider the impact on everyone else at 2i2c of letting their behavior continue unchecked.
* 2i2c only works as an open, participatory, community-driven community because of shared trust between community members. **Reporting code of conduct violations helps us identify when this trust is broken, to prevent that from happening in the future.**


### Where and how to report

Please report all code of conduct violations using [our reporting form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeKFuoghGzftqqgaa0xllZyocdUJsWZmoSaFFlerimg4n_Y8A/viewform?usp=sf_link). This is a short Google Form that will be sent to the Executive Director.

If you would rather discuss the matter in person with a team member, send a direct message in the 2i2c Slack, or email a Steering Council member to schedule a time to talk.


### Confidentiality

We will keep all reports confidential, except if we've discussed with you and agreed otherwise. When we discuss incidents with people who are reported, we will anonymize details as much as we can to protect reporter privacy.

However, some incidents happen in one-on-one interactions, and even if the details are anonymized, the reported person may be able to guess who made the report. If you have concerns about retaliation or your personal safety, and do not want us to share the details of your report with anyone (including the perpetrator) please let us know explicitly in your report. Unfortunately, in that situation we will not be able to take any action.

In some cases we may decide to share an update about a major incident with 2i2c team members, or with the entire 2i2c community. If that's the case, the identities of all victims and reporters will remain confidential unless those individuals instruct us otherwise.


## Social rules

In addition to having a code of conduct, we have four lightweight [social rules](social-rules.md). The social rules are different and separate from the code of conduct. They help us create a better learning environment by giving names to counterproductive behavior and acting as a release valve so that frustration doesn't build up over time. We understand and anticipate people to unintentionally break the social rules from time to time. Doing this doesn't make you a bad person or a bad community member. When this happens, it's not a big deal. Just apologize and move on.

The enforcement provisions in this code of conduct do not apply to the social rules. We won't give you a strong warning or expel you from the 2i2c community just for breaking a social rule.

If you have any questions about any part of the code of conduct or social rules, please reach out to any 2i2c team member.


## How we developed the code of conduct

We arrived at these policies by a combination of:

* Listening to feedback and suggestions we've heard from open source communities over many years
* Reading the codes of conduct of other organizations we find to be thoughtful (see some examples below)
* Considering our experiences in other communities and projects in the past


## Other things that don’t fit in to the code of conduct

### When to seek help immediately

Instead of filling out a code of conduct violation report, please contact law enforcement directly to report criminal activity (e.g. physical assault, sexual assault, theft), or to report a dangerous physical situation (e.g. fire, serious injury, fear that someone will hurt themselves or someone else).

### Getting help

If you or someone else at 2i2c is struggling and needs help, don’t hesitate to reach out to the 2i2c Directors and Steering Council members in person or over email.

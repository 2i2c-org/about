# Team communication

There are a few different communication channels with 2i2c, depending on your team and what kind of communication you'd like to have.
See below for details.

## Asynchronous communication

Most communication should be asynchronous - this means you communicate without the expectation that another person immediately responds.
Asynchronous communication is more inclusive of team members that are spread across many time zones and with many responsibilities.
By default, try to keep it async!

### General discussion between the team

For those who are doing daily work with 2i2c, we use [GitHub Discussions](https://docs.github.com/en/discussions) for our asynchronous conversation.
There are a few different discussion forums depending on the kind of conversation you'd like to have:

- General team discussion: [2i2c-org/team-compass/discussions](https://2i2c-org/team-compass/discussions)
- Discussion specifically about the pilot hubs: [2i2c-org/pilot-hubs/discussions](https://2i2c-org/pilot-hubs/discussions)
- Team discussion that needs to be private (this should be low-volume): [2i2c-org/meta/discussions](https://2i2c-org/meta/discussions)

### To-do items and deliverables

For tracking actionable items and conversation around them, 2i2c uses GitHub issues and pull-requests.
Check the repositories in [the `2i2c-org` GitHub org](https://github.com/2i2c-org) for where these conversations happen.

In addition, check [the active projects page](../projects/index.md) for a list of active projects and links to where communication is happening around them.

Team members are expected to monitor repositories that are important to the work that they are doing. Keep up-to-date with new issues and comments on pre-existing issues.

### Steering Council discussion

The Steering Council of 2i2c conducts asynchronous discussion via [GitHub Issues in the `meta/` repository](https://github.com/2i2c-org/meta/issues).
However, this may change in the future ([see this issue for context](https://github.com/2i2c-org/meta/issues/182)).


## Synchronous communication

Synchronous communication assumes that there are one or more people communicating directly with each other at the same time.
This is usually for informal communication between team members (ie, information that does not need to be tracked over time).

:::{important}
Any conversations that are important or that should be remembered outside of the immediate context should be encoded as Discussion threads, GitHub Issues, or otherwise put in a more asynchronous place so that others may discover it and participate.

Here are things that **should not** be conducted synchronously, but instead put in an issue or other "Source of Truth" location:

- Important updates on the status of a project or issue
- Decisions that were made from conversations in Slack
- Important dates or deadlines announced on Slack
- Major bugs or problems that were unconvered on Slack
- New ideas that warrant follow-up

### Team coordination

Team coordination generally happens via the 2i2c Slack channel ([http://2i2c.slack.com/](http://2i2c.slack.com/)).
In particular in the `#team-updates` channel as well as in the hub-specific channels (e.g., those beginning with `#hub-`).
This is generally used for quick coordination, hand-offs, and requests for help or reviews.
It is not used for official records or planning.

### Informal communication

Informal communication happens in the 2i2c Slack channel ([http://2i2c.slack.com/](http://2i2c.slack.com/)).
This Slack has both 2i2c staff and Steering Conucil members, as well as several other interested parties.



## Slack

### Who is invited to the Slack?

Currently, anyone who is interested can join the 2i2c Slack. Initially this is people that mentioned they would like to join via our blog post. Any Slack member is welcome to send an invite link to another person that would like to join.

### Private vs. Public rooms in the Slack

There are a mix of private and public rooms in the Slack. In general, conversations about projects, development, etc should be in public rooms. **Most conversation in the 2i2c Slack should be in public channels**.

We'll create private rooms for a few specific topics that probably warrant private conversation. By default, we'll start with:

- `#partnerships` - to discuss new partnerships with 2i2c
- `#recruiting` - to discuss hiring with 2i2c

and eventually

- `#sales` - to discuss new sales leads etc

Conversation about more sensitive topics like *pursuing* collaborations, sales, etc should be in a private room until it's appropriate to start discussing in public channels. By default, all 2i2c staff, key volunteers, and founders will have access to all private rooms (it is only the "friends of 2i2c" and users that do not have access).

### What rooms to use?

We try to keep the number of rooms to a minimum, and only add new rooms if it really feels necessary (e.g. if we keep having "off topic" conversations about the same topic in one room). Over time, we can revisit the Slack rooms that we use, and add / prune as needed.

### Bots

We use the [GitHub bots](https://slack.github.com/) to track github issues that are relevant to Slack channels, and explore more integrations in the future. In general we should only use the bot to mirror comments if a repository is *obviously always relevant* to a channel. Otherwise, only mirror comments that are *tagged with a particular label* (e.g. `#recruiting`).


## Taking time off

First and foremost, 2i2c fosters a culture of healthy balance between work and life. All 2i2c team members should take the time they need to thrive - this will both make you happier and help us accomplish our mission most effectively.

The 2i2c team uses [a shared Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/2?cid=Y19pNTJqZGNhbTZ0M3FsaDF1NTNqdG42MjNwY0Bncm91cC5jYWxlbmRhci5nb29nbGUuY29t) to keep track of when team members will be away.
Everyone at 2i2c has access to it, and has the ability to add events to this calendar.

**Use the Calendar to let the team know you're taking time off**.
Here are the reasons that you might do so:

**Personal Time Off**: If you're taking personal time off (e.g., vacation, holidays, personal leave, etc), add an event to this calendar with a title to let others know you'll be away.

For example:

```
AWAY: <your name> - <optional reason>
```

**Reduced time**: If you expect to be on **reduced time** for an extended period, please use the calendar for this as well.

For example:

```
REDUCED: <your name> - <optional reason>
```

**Holidays**: Please add any national holidays for your location of residence if you expect that you (or others in your location) may take time off for this as well.

For example:

```
HOLIDAY: <holiday name>
```

# Communication channels

There are a few different communication channels with 2i2c, depending on your team and what kind of communication you'd like to have.
See below for details.

## Asynchronous communication

Most communication should be asynchronous - this means you communicate without the expectation that another person immediately responds.
Asynchronous communication is more inclusive of team members that are spread across many time zones and with many responsibilities.
By default, try to keep it async!

### General discussion between the team

For those who are doing daily work with 2i2c, we use [GitHub Discussions](https://docs.github.com/en/discussions) for our asynchronous conversation.
There are a few different discussion forums depending on the kind of conversation you'd like to have:

- General team discussion: [2i2c-org/team-compass/discussions](https://github.com/2i2c-org/team-compass/discussions)
- Discussion specifically about the pilot hubs: [2i2c-org/infrastructure/discussions](https://github.com/2i2c-org/infrastructure/discussions)
- Team discussion that needs to be private (this should be low-volume): [2i2c-org/meta/discussions](https://github.com/2i2c-org/meta/discussions)

### To-do items and deliverables

For tracking actionable items and conversation around them, 2i2c uses GitHub issues and pull-requests.
Check the repositories in [the `2i2c-org` GitHub org](https://github.com/2i2c-org) for where these conversations happen.

In addition, check [the active projects page](../projects/index.md) for a list of active projects and links to where communication is happening around them.

Team members are expected to monitor repositories that are important to the work that they are doing. Keep up-to-date with new issues and comments on pre-existing issues.

### Steering Council discussion

The Steering Council of 2i2c conducts asynchronous discussion via [GitHub Issues in the `meta/` repository](https://github.com/2i2c-org/meta/issues).
However, this may change in the future ([see this issue for context](https://github.com/2i2c-org/meta/issues/182)).


## Synchronous communication

Synchronous communication assumes that there are one or more people communicating directly with each other at the same time.
This is usually for informal communication between team members (ie, information that does not need to be tracked over time).

:::{important}
Any conversations that are important or that should be remembered outside of the immediate context should be encoded as Discussion threads, GitHub Issues, or otherwise put in a more asynchronous place so that others may discover it and participate.

Here are things that **should not** be conducted synchronously, but instead put in an issue or other "Source of Truth" location:

- Important updates on the status of a project or issue
- Decisions that were made from conversations in Slack
- Important dates or deadlines announced on Slack
- Major bugs or problems that were unconvered on Slack
- New ideas that warrant follow-up

### Team coordination

Team coordination generally happens via the 2i2c Slack channel ([http://2i2c.slack.com/](http://2i2c.slack.com/)).
In particular in the `#team-updates` channel as well as in the hub-specific channels (e.g., those beginning with `#hub-`).
This is generally used for quick coordination, hand-offs, and requests for help or reviews.
It is not used for official records or planning.

### Informal communication

Informal communication happens in the 2i2c Slack channel ([http://2i2c.slack.com/](http://2i2c.slack.com/)).
This Slack has both 2i2c staff and Steering Conucil members, as well as several other interested parties.

(communication:zoom)=
## Zoom

Our team has a dedicated Zoom room that anybody on the 2i2c team may use.
We try not to publicly post this link to avoid the likelihood of abuse.
The room is password-protected but accessible to anybody that joins via the link.
Ask any team member what the URL is (it is easy to remember) if you wish to join.

In addition, the Zoom account that is connected to this room is also available for any 2i2c team member to use.
The username for this account is `hello@2i2c.org` and you should ask a team member for the password if you wish to use it.

For public-facing zoom meetings that are hosted with this account, create a zoom link that is unique to the meeting, rather than using the general team room.

## Slack

### Who is invited to the Slack?

Currently, anyone who is interested can join the 2i2c Slack. Initially this is people that mentioned they would like to join via our blog post. Any Slack member is welcome to send an invite link to another person that would like to join.

### Private and Public channels

We try to keep the number of channels to a minimum, and only add new rooms if it really feels necessary (e.g. if we keep having "off topic" conversations about the same topic in one room).
There are a mix of private and public rooms in the Slack. In general, conversations about projects, development, etc should be in public rooms. **Most conversation in the 2i2c Slack should be in public channels**.

There are private channels for a few specific topics that probably warrant private conversation. By default, we'll start with:

- `#team-updates` - is for 2i2c team members to share information with one another about what they are up to
- `#leads-and-partnerships` - is for discussing **prospective** collaborations, communities we may serve, or funding opportunities

In addition, we may create private rooms on a short-term basis for specific events (such as discussing hiring a specific role).

## Taking time off

It's critical that you communicate with team members when you intend to take time off.
This helps the team plan for your absence, and ensures that we are spreading work equitably and intentionally.
See [](hr/time-off) for our practices and policies for taking time off.

# Team meetings

There are a few kinds of synchronous meetings that we create space for.
This section describes the kinds of meetings we use and why they exist.

:::{seealso}
See the [Team Calendar page](team/calendar) for specific dates and information about each of these meetings.

## Guidelines for all team meetings

There are a few guidelines that we follow for all team meetings.
They are listed below.

- All planned team meetings should be encoded asnychronously somehow (e.g., via GitHub Issues, notes in our team compass, etc).
- All meetings should have an agenda that includes estimations of time and is ideally filled out 24 hours in advance.
- All meetings should have a designated person for each [role in a team meeting](meetings:roles).
- In general, [meeting roles](meetings:roles) should rotate between regular attendees of meetings in order to share work and build groups skills.
- All attendees of all meetings follow the [2i2c Code of Conduct](https://team-compass.2i2c.org/en/latest/code-of-conduct/index.html)

(meetings:roles)=
## Roles in team meetings

These are major roles that should be filled by someone explicitly for any team meeting[^1].

[^1]: See [this blog post on team meeting roles](https://cfe.unc.edu/facilitator-recorder-and-timekeeper-roles/) for more inspiration here.

### Facilitator

The role of meeting facilitator is to structure the meeting so that it is well-scoped, and to guide conversation to be productive and inclusive.

:::{admonition} Responsibilities of the Facilitator
- Set the agenda before the meeting (either creating it themselves, or asking for agenda items from others)
- Run the meeting, ensuring that we stay on-time with agenda items and discussion
- Convert actionable items into issues and close-out the meeting issue if it exists
:::

### Recorder

The Meeting Recorder is responsible for encoding the discussion points and actionable items that came out of a meeting.
Their primary goal is to make sure we don't miss something important after the meeting, and ensure that the content of the meeting is saved for reference from others.

:::{admonition} Responsibilities of the Recorder
- Write down major discussion points and ideas during the meeting
- Write down action items / to-dos explicitly so that we know what to follow up on
- Clean up the notes after the meeting
- Archive the notes in the appropriate location (e.g., the Team Compass)
:::

### Timekeeper

The timekeeper's role is primarily to assist the Meeting Facilitator in moving the meeting forward.

:::{admonition} Responsibilities of the Timekeeper
- Keep track of the current time, and provide the Facilitator / meeting attendees cues that help them decide when to move things forward.
:::

## Kinds of recurring meetings

The following are meetings that we regularly hold.

### Monthly team meetings

The 2i2c Team meets **monthly on Tuesdays** for 90 minutes.

See the [Team Calendar page](team/calendar) for information about when and where the meetings are held.

Monthly team meetings are an opportunity to all meet face to face in order to discuss topics that benefit from synchronous conversation.
For example, these are some goals we might have:

- Connect with one another
- Discuss complicated issues that benefit from real-time conversation
- Zoom out and make sure we are on the right track
- Discuss team process issues to make sure we are all supported

It is **not a status update meeting** - this should be done via our GitHub issues and sprint planning!

We use [this HackMD for our team meeting notes and agenda](https://hackmd.io/Y5SBMxV7R6CMqzeTXgm5kA).


(meetings:sprint-planning)=
### Sprint Planning meetings

See [](coordination:sprints) for information about these meetings.

### One on one meetings

In addition to group meetings, we also try to have one-on-one meetings to guide and help one another.
These meetings happen with different cadences and formats for different pairs of people.

In general, the goal of one-on-ones is to provide one another mentorship and feedback that helps us thrive in our positions with 2i2c.
For example, these are some goals you may have for a one-on-one:

- Provide constructive feedback about how somebody could be a better team member
- Provide a chance to reflect on how things are going, and discuss ways that 2i2c's team can improve
- Ensure that our team feels empowered to do great work, and with guidance on what to do next
- Ensure that the needs and goals of our team members are being met

Below is a meeting template that many have found useful, and that you may adapt for your own meetings if you wish.

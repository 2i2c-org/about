# Team meetings

There are a few kinds of synchronous meetings that we create space for.
This section describes the kinds of meetings we use and why they exist.

See the [Team Calendar page](team/calendar) for specific dates and information about each of these meetings.
:::

## Monthly team meetings

The 2i2c Team meets the **first Monday of each month** for 90 minutes.

Monthly team meetings are an opportunity to all meet face to face in order to discuss topics that benefit from synchronous conversation.
For example, these are some goals we might have:

- Connect with one another
- Discuss complicated issues that benefit from real-time conversation
- Zoom out and make sure we are on the right track
- Discuss team process issues to make sure we are all supported

It is **not a status update meeting** - this should be done via our GitHub issues and project boards!

We use [this HackMD for our team meeting notes and agenda](https://hackmd.io/Y5SBMxV7R6CMqzeTXgm5kA).

See the [Team Calendar page](team/calendar) for information about when and where the meetings are held.

## Deliverables review meetings

The 2i2c team meets **every other Tuesday** for 30 minutes.
The goal of this meeting is to review our major work deliverables, synchronize with one another, and prioritize work across team members.
It is also a chance to hand off the Support Steward role to the next person.

You can find the meeting format/agenda {download}`in the Deliverables meeting template <../.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/meeting-deliverables.md>`.

## One on one meetings

In addition to group meetings, we also try to have one-on-one meetings to guide and help one another.
These meetings happen with different cadences and formats for different pairs of people.

In general, the goal of one-on-ones is to provide one another mentorship and feedback that helps us thrive in our positions with 2i2c.
For example, these are some goals you may have for a one-on-one:

- Provide constructive feedback about how somebody could be a better team member
- Provide a chance to reflect on how things are going, and discuss ways that 2i2c's team can improve
- Ensure that our team feels empowered to do great work, and with guidance on what to do next
- Ensure that the needs and goals of our team members are being met

Below is a meeting template that many have found useful, and that you may adapt for your own meetings if you wish.

# Team Practices

As a totally distributed team, it is important to have team practices that give one another insight into what we're working on, identify opportunities to collaborate, and un-block one another.
This chapter describes some of the practices that we adopt towards these goals.

## What are our goals?

Here are the goals we optimize for in organizing our team coordination practices.

- Give team members insight into what one another is working on (not to "report up")
- Look for opportunities to work together and/or support one another's work efficiently
- Provide some social accountability to get stuff done

We want to do this with high efficiency so that people can quickly get on the same page and focus efforts around decision-making and collaboration. We also wish to do it in a ðŸ’¯ remote-friendly way since we are split across many different time-zones.

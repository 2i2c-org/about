# Open Source Infrastructure Engineer

An Open Source Applications Engineer (OSAE) focuses on building features that are in the product roadmap, either by contributing to existing open source applications or when necessary, building new open source applications.

## Key responsibilities

- Work very closely with user communities we serve and others in the Product & Services team to define and deliver new product features on the product roadmap. 
- Be a good software engineering team member by working in highly collaborative ways inside and outside 2i2c.
- Partner with open source application communities by contributing to multiple OSS and Open Science communities in order to build, maintain and improve strategically important applications.

## Necessary qualities

- Experience developing tools in relevant general-purpose programming languages[^relevant].
- Experience with continuous integration services (e.g. Circle CI, GitHub Actions).
- Experience working with distributed service teams that use asynchronous methods of communication
- Experience collaborating and coordinating work via online platforms, such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket, and distributed revision control.

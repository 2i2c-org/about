# Structure and roles

Engineering is led by our {role}`Technology Lead` and {role}`Engineering Manager`.
They define our technical priorities at any moment, and communicate these priorities to others on the team.

This team operates similarly to a **Site Reliability Engineering** team.
It focuses most development efforts on improving the cloud infrastructure that supports our partner communities, rather than developing new features and technology for the use-cases we support.
It balances a combination of **operations** and **development** focused around our cloud infrastructure.

They are expected to coordinate with other leads within 2i2c in order to ensure that our technical priorities reflect our organizational priorities for impact.
Our **Project Manager** ensures that we have an efficient system for coordinating and planning our work, and **our engineering team** carries out most technical implementations and operations for 2i2c.

Below are major roles and teams...

# Structure and roles

Engineering is led by our {role}`Technology Lead` and {role}`Engineering Manager`.
They define our technical priorities at any moment, and communicate these priorities to others on the team.

This team operates similarly to a **Site Reliability Engineering** team.
It focuses most development efforts on improving the cloud infrastructure that supports our partner communities, rather than developing new features and technology for the use-cases we support.
It balances a combination of **operations** and **development** focused around our cloud infrastructure.

They are expected to coordinate with other leads within 2i2c in order to ensure that our technical priorities reflect our organizational priorities for impact.

## Career Ladders

We take heavy inspiration from two open-source career ladders:
* https://www.engineeringladders.com/
* https://career-ladders.dev/

Both ladders propose different workflows although we can identify some similarities we take advantage of.
We have adapted pieces from both ladders as follows:

1. We use **Axes** and **Levels** as described in the Introduction page at https://www.engineeringladders.com/
2. Our Developer track is based on https://www.engineeringladders.com/Developer.html
3. Our Engineering Manager track is based on https://www.engineeringladders.com/EngineeringManager.html, although we added an additional EM4 level described below.
4. The Tech Lead is a role that can be played by anyone in the team **at different levels**: https://career-ladders.dev/engineering#tech-lead. This is a substantial difference from the dedicated Tead Lead ladder proposed by engineeringladders.com. Our existing [Technology Lead role](./roles/technology-lead.md) represents a Tech Lead with high seniority (D4 and above).
5. We also introduce **steps** for each numbered level as a way to build salary bands and enhance the granularity. It is expected that engineers advance step by step before entering a new level, although a whole-level jump may exist if there are enough reasons to justify it.
6. Steps are evaluated every 6 months for 1-3 levels and every year for 4-7 levels, whereas numbered levels are evaluated every year for 1-3 levels and every 2 years for 4-7 levels.

We have an internal and engineering-specific salary bands matrix associated with each level at https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1D_-RzXhyWw8jFs7KQQXKVRV4VrmOyXjQni2UTnk1044/edit#gid=0.

* Evangelizes: researches, creates proofs of concept and introduces new technologies to the team
* Owns: owns the production operation and monitoring of the system and is aware of its SLAs
* Coordinates: manages the team membersâ€™ career, expectations, performance and level of happiness
* Challenges: adjusts the team processes, listening to feedback and guiding the team through the changes
* Team: makes an impact on the whole team, not just on specific parts of it

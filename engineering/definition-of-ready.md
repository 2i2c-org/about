# Engineering work definition of ready

The engineering team gets many different kinds of work from many different sources. An important question for solving these work items is: _**is something ready to be worked on?**_

Answering this question, requires at least the following information:

- What kind of work item something is
- Does it have all the information needed for a member of the engineering team to start working on?
- If it does not, what exactly is the information needed? And who is responsible for providing it?
- Once all the information is provided, is there explicit documentation on what actually needs to be done?

## Work categorization

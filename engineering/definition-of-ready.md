# Engineering work definition of ready

The engineering team gets many different kinds of work from many different sources. An important question for solving these work items is: _**is something ready to be worked on?**_

Answering this question, requires at least the following information:

- [What kind of work item something is](dor:categorization)
- [Does it have all the information needed for a member of the engineering team to start working on?](dor:ready)
- If it does not, what exactly is the information needed? And who is responsible for providing it?
- Once all the information is provided, is there explicit documentation on what actually needs to be done?

3. New Hub
4. Config Change
5. Fault Fixing
6. Community Config Change Review
7. Incident Response
8. Routing

# Task Sizing

During the [](meetings:sprint-planning) meeting, tasks are sized to estimate the amount of effort they will require to complete so that we can ensure that the team is not overwhelmed during an iteration.

## Method for sizing

The team currently implement [story points](https://www.thoughtworks.com/en-ca/insights/blog/all-about-point) for sizing.
A task from the Refined column is chosen to be the smallest possible task (given a points value of 1), and all other tasks are sized in comparison to this item using a "poker" voting system, such as [PlanItPoker](https://planitpoker.com/).
If a task of story points value 1 cannot be found, team members will vote on the task they believe could be the smallest task.

## Retroactively assigning or modifying story points

```{attention}
The practices documented below are unconventional and the team may wish to reflect on whether there are better suited practices we should implement, or whether we should commit to these fully.
```

### Unplanned work

Unplanned work is any item worked on during an iteration that was not explicitly committed to, by means of being added to the Committed column of the Engineering board, during the Iteration Planning meeting.

Sometimes unplanned work comes in via channels outside of the planning meeting, such as partnerships support or tech support.
The team member assigned to complete the task assigns story points as they see fit.

### Modifying story points

_Very occasionally_, if a team member has spent more effort than expected on a task, the story points assigned to that task have been altered to reflect the expended effort.
This is so that the total points for the iteration is accurate when the team come to plan the next iteration.

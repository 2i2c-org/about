# Where to look for information

There are three major sources of information within 2i2c:

## Documentation

The most stable form of information in 2i2c is documentation that our teams maintain.
This is where most information about 2i2c exists.
Here are a few major documentation sources for 2i2c:

- [**`team-compass.2i2c.org`**](https://team-compass.2i2c.org) (this website): The {term}`Source of Truth` for all 2i2c information and policies.
- [**`infrastructure.2i2c.org`**](https://infrastructure.2i2c.org): Information about our cloud infrastructure and deployment configuration.
- [**`docs.2i2c.org`**](https://docs.2i2c.org): Documentation about our Managed JupyterHub Service.

## Google Drive

We have a Google Drive folder that contains all of 2i2c's documents that don't fit into GitHub.

This is a folder under Chris's Google Drive account, and it is shared with all 2i2c members (so your `@2i2c.org` address will provide access).

## Public GitHub Issues

Most of our conversations, planning, and work tracking happens in GitHub.
See [](coordination:workflow) for more information.

## Private GitHub Issues

There are a few repositories that we use for tracking private conversations and issues.
This is usually personally sensitive or identifiable information, or information that needs to be private until decisions or deals are finalized.

- [**`2i2c-org/meta`**](https://github.com/2i2c-org/meta): Private team and organizational conversation.
- [**`2i2c-org/leads`**](https://github.com/2i2c-org/leads): Tracking and discussing potential collaborations, partnerships, and communities for our hub service.

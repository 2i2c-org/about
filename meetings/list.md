# List of meetings

The following are meetings that we regularly hold. See the [team calendar](../reference/calendar.md) for a list of all team meeting times.

```{contents} Team meetings
:local:
```

## Content meetings

The goal of content meetings is to focus discussion on a particular topic in order to _reduce uncertainty_, _define a path forward_, and _make decisions_ that require synchronous conversation.
The agenda is driven by the leads of relevant functional areas though anybody may attend.

### Product and Engineering

Covers the direction of our service and the technical aspects of our cloud infrastructure.
This includes ideas for how the infrastructure should improve, major development effort planning, and refining SRE and development issues.

It is led by our **`Engineering`** and **`Product`** teams.

- **Date**: [every Tuesday at **4pm CET**](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=c_nq8hl7qsm484g1p7mfkm29jpo8%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America%2FLos_Angeles)
- **Notes and Agenda**: [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dUO2USQlRbcjOEkjlCu1gyTaPBZmGZSRF4L-_9xecmA/edit?usp=sharing)

### Community and Partnerships

Covers our interactions with external communities and stakeholders, including our leads and invoicing pipelines and our community guidance efforts.
This also includes building tutorials and learning material for communities.

It is led by our **`Community`** and **`Partnerships`** teams.

- **Date**: [every Thursday at **4pm CET**](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=c_nq8hl7qsm484g1p7mfkm29jpo8%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America%2FLos_Angeles)

### Organizational strategy

See [](organization:meeting-strategy).

## Monthly retrospectives

The 2i2c Team has a retrospective **on the last Tuesday of each month** for 60 minutes, with an optional 30-minute extra time afterwards if we really need to extend conversation.
The goal is to reflect on our team process and how things are going, and finding ways to improve.

Monthly team meetings are an opportunity to all meet face to face in order to discuss how things are going, reflect on our team practices, share anything that is stressing us out, and identify ways to improve our processes.

:::{admonition} Example team processes

Here are an example of some team processes that we should consider for this meeting.

- how we handle incidents
- the roles, teams, and responsibilities we define in our service (cloud engineer, support steward, meeting facilitator, etc)
- current meetings structure, cadence, etc
- how we communicate asynchronously (e.g., GitHub comment structure)
- how we track and plan our work (e.g. GitHub Project boards)
- how we track new requests for work and hubs (e.g. our support pipeline)

See [](eng/index.md) for a list of previous meeting notes.

## Sprint planning meeting

The team conducts a Sprint Planning meeting for 60 minutes at the beginning of each sprint.
The goal of this meeting is to review our major work items, synchronize with one another, and prioritize work across team members.

Our **Project Manager** role leads these meetings.

See [the Sprint Planning issue template](https://github.com/2i2c-org/team-compass/blob/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/meeting-sprint-planning.md) for the agenda / structure of these meetings.

See [](coordination:sprints) for information about our sprint cycles.

(coordination:team-syncs)=
## Asynchronous team syncs

Throughout the week we have a lightweight asynchronous team sync process so that we can get on the same page.
These currently happen on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday in the morning time of each team member.
The primary goals of this process are:

- To ensure that nobody is stuck on something
- To signal-boost requests for review and help
- To provide accountability of what we've been up to
- To help us coordinate what to do next

We use [the Geekbot](https://geekbot.com/) to manage this process.
During a sync, each team member gets a message in their morning time with a few questions.
Answer each question, and at the end the answers will be posted to our `#team-updates` channel.

:::{seealso}
You can customize the way that Geekbot standups work for you.
See [the Geekbot workflow guides](https://help.geekbot.com/en/articles/4283332-commands-how-to-streamline-your-workflow) for some helpful information.

:::{admonition} TODO: Share this publicly
We are exploring ways to aggregate and share our team sync activity publicly, to be more transparent with others about what we are up to.
We will update this section once we better-understand this process.

## One on one meetings

One on one meetings are for making personal connection, reflecting on how things are going, and providing feedback with an individual person.
These meetings happen with different cadences and formats for different pairs of people.

In general, the goal of one-on-ones is to provide one another mentorship and feedback that helps us thrive in our positions with 2i2c.
For example, these are some goals you may have for a one-on-one:

- Provide constructive feedback about how somebody could be a better team member
- Provide a chance to reflect on how things are going, and discuss ways that 2i2c's team can improve
- Ensure that our team feels empowered to do great work, and with guidance on what to do next
- Ensure that the needs and goals of our team members are being met

Below is a meeting template that many have found useful, and that you may adapt for your own meetings if you wish.

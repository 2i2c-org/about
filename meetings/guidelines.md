# Meeting guidelines

There are a few kinds of synchronous meetings that we create space for.
This section describes the kinds of meetings we use and why they exist.

All attendees of all meetings follow the [2i2c Code of Conduct](https://team-compass.2i2c.org/en/latest/code-of-conduct/index.html)

## Notes and agenda should be available to the team

All planned team meetings should be encoded asnychronously with a clear link so that others may follow along.
It can be a GitHub Issue, a Google Doc, a HackMD, etc, but it must be clearly stated.

It is recommended to encode the meeting time and video link information in the notes document so that others have a single place to go to for connection information.

## Define an agenda ahead of time

All meetings should have an agenda that is available at least 24 hours ahead of time.
This should have:

- Enough information that somebody can understand whether this meeting is relevant to them.
- Decisions that must be made or questions that must be answered.
- A rough estimate of how the meeting's time will be split.

## Define a notetaker, timekeeper, and a facilitator

All meetings should have a designated person for each [role in a team meeting](meetings:roles). In general, [meeting roles](meetings:roles) should rotate between regular attendees of meetings in order to share work and build groups skills.

## Roles in team meetings

These are major roles that should be filled by someone explicitly for any team meeting[^1].

[^1]: See [this blog post on team meeting roles](https://cfe.unc.edu/facilitator-recorder-and-timekeeper-roles/) for more inspiration here.

### Facilitator

The role of meeting facilitator is to structure the meeting so that it is well-scoped, and to guide conversation to be productive and inclusive.

:::{seealso}
See [our Team Roles calendar](team-roles-calendar) to know when each team member serves in this role.
:::

#### Responsibilities of the Facilitator

Before the meeting
:  - Collect rough agenda items from team members
   - Set the agenda

During the meeting
: Run the meeting, ensuring that conversations are inclusive and productive


#### Who serves as the facilitator?

Everybody on the engineering team, on a rotating basis.
We rotate meeting facilitators **every month** and transition this role at the beginning of the month.
The meeting facilitator rotates through the `@tech-team` usergroup on Slack in alphabetical order, using the code in the [`team-roles-geekbot-sweep` repository](https://github.com/2i2c-org/team-roles-geekbot-sweep).
That repository also automatically generates [Geekbot Standups](https://geekbot.com/) that notifies which member of the engineering team in due to take over the role at the start of the month.

### Recorder

The Meeting Recorder is responsible for encoding the discussion points and actionable items that came out of a meeting.
Their primary goal is to make sure that the content of the meeting is saved for reference from others.

#### Responsibilities of the Recorder

- Write down major discussion points and ideas during the meeting
- Write down action items / to-dos explicitly so that we know what to follow up on

### Timekeeper

The timekeeper's role is primarily to assist the Meeting Facilitator in moving the meeting forward.

Currently, the Meeting Facilitator delegates this responsibility to [this Cuckoo.Team app](https://cuckoo.team/2i2c).

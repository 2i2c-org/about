### New job posting for product/community lead

- ref: https://github.com/2i2c-org/meta/issues/256
- Role will be focused on maximizing the impact for communities using our infrastructure
- A combination of community impact, training, and helping guide our service development
- They should focus on the infrastructure from the user's perspective, not an engineer's, but work with engineering
- Intro discussion:
  - CH: Background consideration: What major things would help any community? Currently, we don't have capacity to communicate more directly to help the community make get most value out of the hubs. One part of this role is to spearhead the kind of strategy and efforts to help communities use the infra in the most effective way. Another part is to be a more direct contact person. In this way, the person would also help guide future development efforts by aquiring insights about the user experience.
  - CH: Skills relevant for the role:
    - Great communicator, good at teaching, enthusiastic.
    - Capable of leading the development of the role in itself
- Questions:
  - What do others think about the scope of this role? Does it make sense?
    - ES: At Sandvik, it would have been helpful to have somebody dedicating time to teaching others how to make use of the service.
      - Collecting user experience data *quickly* rather than *slowly* can be critical.
      - "They'd be in a unique position to validate the value of certain features".
      - Could this role write feature proposals for open source communities?
    - GD: Could help build trust with communities, by having a more human connection
  - How can we incorporate this role into our team planning processes?
    - Feature requests and shaping for our communities
    - They will need to talk to engineers to know what is easy vs. hard vs. impossible to implement
    - Could set set up a process to plan/prioritize our next work?
      - If so, this person could be involved in this discussion
      - They will have a good perspective on what to prioritize

### Does needing a specific datacenter require a dedicated cluster?

When communities want a hub to run in a particular datacenter, does this mean we must give them their own cluster? (10m)

- ref: https://2i2c.slack.com/archives/C0206KLF76E/p1643677108490539
- CH: A user wants a hub in a specific data center, but doesn't need a dedicated cluster.
  - SG: This is probably to a large extent related to egress/ingress costs. We will need a new cluster in this case, but should we make it shared or dedicated to them?
  - SG: Of course, a shared cluster would imply we ensure to avoid bleeding credentials to access relevant resources between communities.
  - ES/CH/Yuvi: What about cost of egress and billing? It simplifies billing, because we can't separate costs related to egress traffic.
  - YP: Networking performance gains to co-locate with data.
  - CH: If we were launching into separate clusters w/ the multi-cluster spawner, would that create a really huge list of user profiles people had to choose between?
    - SG: You can restrict the access that individuals have to different clusters, may also be able to restrict visibility
    - YP: Cluster-spawner would reduce complexity of the spawned clusters
    - CH: Want to avoid this: shared hub, 20 clusters to select from, 19 is totally irrelevant...
    - ES: Off topic relevant ide: provide ping times
    - ES: What are limitations for users of using a central cluster spawner to access a hub?

### OpenScapes outage

- We might be thinking about this when it comes to the pangeo Binder
- Would testing fix this?
  - In some cases, maybe, but not always
  - For hubs that *want* to have full access, testing would not be a fix
- Scenario where somebody *wants* to have full access
  - A time-boxed workshop where you don't want to hassle with manually adding a bunch of people
- Could email reporting address this?
  - Having a single grafana that aggregates across the prometheus for each hub would help
  - Not clear how you'd be able to access
- Could RBAC address this?
  - RBAC maps onto specific permissions in the hub, it's a bit more complex for arbitrary permissions mapping
- About more convenient authorization logic, an issue about a hook: https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyterhub/issues/3490
- Other project ideas
  - Erik: interested in Helm validation, but wants more consensus on what our helm config structure should be first.
  - Sarah: Standardize our Terraform structure across providers so that we minimize complexity associated with provider-specific stuff.
    - Figuring out a workaround for ConfigConnector. Scratch buckets + requestor pays access are two things that'd be enabled by this.
  - Chris: Help with migrating the Pangeo documentation. Can coordinate with Sarah to figure out which ones
- Damian: Improving our staging and testing environments will make it easier to iterate and develop new things - this is also related to the Helm validation stuff that we discussed.

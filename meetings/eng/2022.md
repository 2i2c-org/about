# 2022 Meeting Notes

## 2022-03

- **Meeting facilitator**: @erik
- **Meeting timekeeper**: @damian
- **Meeting recorder**: @erik

### Quick updates

- New job will be posted this or next week. Feedback is encouraged! https://github.com/2i2c-org/2i2c-org.github.io/pull/93

### Hub service growth plan

- Currently serving about 20-25 communities.
- Large variability in size. Some as small as 2-3 (Catalyst Cooperative), some as large as 200-300 (Toronto)
- Large variability in complexity. Some have vanilla data8 environments (community colleges), others have monumental Dockerfiles (Pangeo)
- As we grow, we also create more work for ourselves.
- At the end of our runway (say, 24 months), we need to have a sustainable model.
- What's the right way to _intentionally_ grow so that we can refine our infrastructure and processes?

#### Proposal

- Phases of growth with fixed number of "slots" for communities in each phase.
- Three major areas that we are working out
  - Infrastructure / tech
  - Process for operations and support
  - Sales and invoicing
- For each area, define questions that we want to answer, or conditions that we want to meet, in order to trigger a new batch of communities that we'll take on.
- Write up a blog post about this plan and share it for feedback, even if we don't intend on taking on any new communities for some time.

#### Questions to ask

**What should our target number of communities be?** (for now, in 1 month, in 3 months?)

- Currently we have around 15 basic hubs, 7 research hubs, 3 experimental hubs
- We need different kinds of slots to help indicate the amount of work they involve:
  - The amount of usage
  - Customization to authenticators
  - Image complexity: entirely custom image, repo2docker based image
  - Hub adjustments: sidecar, gpu
  - Initial development efforts
  - Community knowledge: they offload us by avoiding issues in the first place, and being able to understand the complexity of what they need

**What is in scope, what isn't?**

- More standardized hubs -> we can support more communities. We need to have a grasp of what we aim for with regards to this.
  - Avoid one off features
- Answer 1: Projecting into the feature is one way to answer
  - Sarah: very few new communities *right now*, because we are to handle a new hub type: binderhubs

**What is our biggest source of risk?**

If there were one thing you'd focus on to boost our capacity, what would it be?

- What can constrain our growth?
  - unreliability in automation to deploy, it is a timesink and can also break your focus repeatedly while waiting
  - we have made experimental exceptions on what hubs should accomplish
    - Overviewing the experimental adjustments as hubs grow is a challenge
    - While we need to experiment to meet users needs, we need to work to bring back experimentational features to general features or have a practice for managing the experiemental features.
    - Some hubs tends to require more work than others, how do we handle such differences?
  - An engineer needs to gague the complexity of implementing new features and make a call if it is seen as sustainable to maintain.
  - We can be constrained by features only a subset of us understands how to maintain it:
    - "will this feature be something everybody needs to learn about in the end?"
    - We don't want to constrain ourselves to the lowest common denominator of shared knowledge
  - lack of monitoring

#### Goals for the alpha

The goal is a phased approach to growing, for that, we need to think more clearly about our growth goals and define them more explicitly.

Idea: to have a concept of capacity, and how we increase that over time.

### How to improve team coordination or management

- Currently, we're using our weekly check-ins + sprint planning + async issues to coordinate.
- There are a few kinds of work that the engineering team is doing.
  - Development projects (often span multiple weeks, and self-driven)
  - Expected operations tasks (e.g., expected maintenance, setting up a hub, etc)
  - Operations and support tasks (aka, helping when something is wrong, more unpredictable and come with more urgency)
- The last two things are tricky - they are more unpredictable, but also more important that we do them quickly and on schedule.
  - This is particularly important when interfacing with sales, since a sales person will make a commitment to running the hub by a certain date.
- Ultimately, we need to be able to:
  - Give somebody a concrete date (or guaranteed turnaround time) when their issue is resolved / hub is deployed / etc.
  - Be confident in our team processes that we will definitely get it done by that date, or raise a flag to change plan.
- Our current model assumes that Chris is keeping the context of what everybody is working on in his head, but this is not scalable.
  - Chris feels like he is dropping balls in guiding others, refining issues, etc.
  - Also hard because he doesn't have the skillset of a cloud engineer.

#### Questions

A few questions and ideas:

- **How can we improve our team processes to reduce the uncertainty around finishing support / operations issues**?
  - Discussion:
    - Our incomming requests are hard to quickly create an action point to finish. Its often back and forth.
    - First line of support, second line of support
      - First line are generalists, they answer questions coming from all areas and help elicit relevant background information for the specialists
      - Second line of support are specialists
  - Answers:
    - The support steward acts as the first line of support
    - Training for first line of support!
      - Digital educational content?
    - Defining mechanisms on to ensure support tickets resolve, or perhaps having a dedicated role to drive operations

### Follow-up items

### New job posting for product/community lead

- ref: https://github.com/2i2c-org/meta/issues/256
- Role will be focused on maximizing the impact for communities using our infrastructure
- A combination of community impact, training, and helping guide our service development
- They should focus on the infrastructure from the user's perspective, not an engineer's, but work with engineering
- Intro discussion:
  - CH: Background consideration: What major things would help any community? Currently, we don't have capacity to communicate more directly to help the community make get most value out of the hubs. One part of this role is to spearhead the kind of strategy and efforts to help communities use the infra in the most effective way. Another part is to be a more direct contact person. In this way, the person would also help guide future development efforts by aquiring insights about the user experience.
  - CH: Skills relevant for the role:
    - Great communicator, good at teaching, enthusiastic.
    - Capable of leading the development of the role in itself
- Questions:
  - What do others think about the scope of this role? Does it make sense?
    - ES: At Sandvik, it would have been helpful to have somebody dedicating time to teaching others how to make use of the service.
      - Collecting user experience data *quickly* rather than *slowly* can be critical.
      - "They'd be in a unique position to validate the value of certain features".
      - Could this role write feature proposals for open source communities?
    - GD: Could help build trust with communities, by having a more human connection
  - How can we incorporate this role into our team planning processes?
    - Feature requests and shaping for our communities
    - They will need to talk to engineers to know what is easy vs. hard vs. impossible to implement
    - Could set set up a process to plan/prioritize our next work?
      - If so, this person could be involved in this discussion
      - They will have a good perspective on what to prioritize

### Does needing a specific datacenter require a dedicated cluster?

When communities want a hub to run in a particular datacenter, does this mean we must give them their own cluster? (10m)

- ref: https://2i2c.slack.com/archives/C0206KLF76E/p1643677108490539
- CH: A user wants a hub in a specific data center, but doesn't need a dedicated cluster.
  - SG: This is probably to a large extent related to egress/ingress costs. We will need a new cluster in this case, but should we make it shared or dedicated to them?
  - SG: Of course, a shared cluster would imply we ensure to avoid bleeding credentials to access relevant resources between communities.
  - ES/CH/Yuvi: What about cost of egress and billing? It simplifies billing, because we can't separate costs related to egress traffic.
  - YP: Networking performance gains to co-locate with data.
  - CH: If we were launching into separate clusters w/ the multi-cluster spawner, would that create a really huge list of user profiles people had to choose between?
    - SG: You can restrict the access that individuals have to different clusters, may also be able to restrict visibility
    - YP: Cluster-spawner would reduce complexity of the spawned clusters
    - CH: Want to avoid this: shared hub, 20 clusters to select from, 19 is totally irrelevant...
    - ES: Off topic relevant ide: provide ping times
    - ES: What are limitations for users of using a central cluster spawner to access a hub?

### OpenScapes outage

- We might be thinking about this when it comes to the pangeo Binder
- Would testing fix this?
  - In some cases, maybe, but not always
  - For hubs that *want* to have full access, testing would not be a fix
- Scenario where somebody *wants* to have full access
  - A time-boxed workshop where you don't want to hassle with manually adding a bunch of people
- Could email reporting address this?
  - Having a single grafana that aggregates across the prometheus for each hub would help
  - Not clear how you'd be able to access
- Could RBAC address this?
  - RBAC maps onto specific permissions in the hub, it's a bit more complex for arbitrary permissions mapping
- About more convenient authorization logic, an issue about a hook: https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyterhub/issues/3490
- Other project ideas
  - Erik: interested in Helm validation, but wants more consensus on what our helm config structure should be first.
  - Sarah: Standardize our Terraform structure across providers so that we minimize complexity associated with provider-specific stuff.
    - Figuring out a workaround for ConfigConnector. Scratch buckets + requestor pays access are two things that'd be enabled by this.
  - Chris: Help with migrating the Pangeo documentation. Can coordinate with Sarah to figure out which ones
- Damian: Improving our staging and testing environments will make it easier to iterate and develop new things - this is also related to the Helm validation stuff that we discussed.

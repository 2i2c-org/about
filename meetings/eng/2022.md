### OpenScapes outage

- We might be thinking about this when it comes to the pangeo Binder
- Would testing fix this?
  - In some cases, maybe, but not always
  - For hubs that *want* to have full access, testing would not be a fix
- Scenario where somebody *wants* to have full access
  - A time-boxed workshop where you don't want to hassle with manually adding a bunch of people
- Could email reporting address this?
  - Having a single grafana that aggregates across the prometheus for each hub would help
  - Not clear how you'd be able to access 
- Could RBAC address this?
  - RBAC maps onto specific permissions in the hub, it's a bit more complex for arbitrary permissions mapping
- About more convenient authorization logic, an issue about a hook: https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyterhub/issues/3490
- Other project ideas
  - Erik: interested in Helm validation, but wants more consensus on what our helm config structure should be first.
  - Sarah: Standardize our Terraform structure across providers so that we minimize complexity associated with provider-specific stuff.
    - Figuring out a workaround for ConfigConnector. Scratch buckets + requestor pays access are two things that'd be enabled by this. 
  - Chris: Help with migrating the Pangeo documentation. Can coordinate with Sarah to figure out which ones
- Damian: Improving our staging and testing environments will make it easier to iterate and develop new things - this is also related to the Helm validation stuff that we discussed.

# Mission and Values

## Our mission

Our mission is the guiding principle behind everything that we do.
It defines where we should invest in our capabilities, what kind of impact we want to have, and what kind of work we say yes (or no) to.

Our mission is currently defined in [the About pages](https://2i2c.org/about/) of our brochure site.

## Our values

Our values are ideas that we believe are important for 2i2c to follow as it works towards its mission.
We strive to make decisions that align with our values, though recognize that they are sometimes in tension with one another and cannot be followed perfectly.

Our values are currently defined in [the About pages](https://2i2c.org/about/) of our brochure site.

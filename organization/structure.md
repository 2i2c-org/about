# Organizational structure

:::{note}
This page is a work-in-progress as we define the major organizational areas of 2i2c.
Some links might be missing or in-the-works!
:::

This section describes the major **functional areas** of 2i2c, and how they relate to each other.
Note that 2i2c is a young and small organization, so many areas have a small number (or nobody) dedicated to work within them.
We nonetheless document these structures to understand how our work and responsibilities are divided, and to provide a roadmap for new hires and division of labor.

% TODO: Each of these major areas should havea  `<NAME>/structure.md` page that describes that organization's structure and roles (or, a similar page with this information). We can link to each from here.

- **[Organizational leadership](leadership.md)**: Steward the mission, vision, values, and major strategy of 2i2c.
- **[Engineering](../infrastructure/structure.md)**: Develop and operate our technical and cloud infrastructure, to ensure that it is reliable and scalable.
- **Community**: Guide and support the partner communities that we serve, to help them utilize our infrastructure in a way that aligns with 2i2c's mission.
- **Product**: Understand the perspective of our partner communities and guide the evolution of our infrastructure and services, in order to ensure they have a positive impact.
- **Partnerships**: Identify opportunities for impact, cultivate new relationships, and oversee our sustainability plan to ensure that we have sustainable and scalable impact.
- **[Administration](../administration/css.md)**: Carry out ongoing organizational tasks that are needed to keep 2i2c running on a daily basis.

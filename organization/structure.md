# Organizational structure

:::{note}
This page is a work-in-progress as we define the major organizational areas of 2i2c.
Some links might be missing or in-the-works!
:::

This section describes the major structure of 2i2c and how it is broken into functional groups and teams.
Note that 2i2c is a young and small organization, so many areas have a small number (or nobody) dedicated to work within them.
We nonetheless document these structures to understand how our work and responsibilities are divided, and to provide a roadmap for new hires and division of labor.

## Functional areas

Functional areas are organized around _responsibilities, skills, and career tracks_.
Reporting lines are within a functional area, meaning that team members should report to somebody that has held a similar job in the past.

% TODO: Each of these major areas should havea  `<NAME>/structure.md` page that describes that organization's structure and roles (or, a similar page with this information). We can link to each from here.

- **[Organizational leadership](leadership.md)**: Steward the mission, vision, values, and major strategy of 2i2c.
- **[Engineering](../engineering/structure.md)**: Develop and operate our technical and cloud infrastructure, to ensure that it is reliable and scalable.
- **[Product](../product/structure.md)**: Understand the perspective of our partner communities and guide the evolution of our infrastructure and services, in order to ensure they have a positive impact.
- **Community**: Guide and support the partner communities that we serve, to help them utilize our infrastructure in a way that aligns with 2i2c's mission.
- **Partnerships**: Identify opportunities for impact, cultivate new relationships, and oversee our sustainability plan to ensure that we have sustainable and scalable impact.
- **[Operations](../operations/structure.md)**: Oversees our systems for coordination, planning, and executing our work according to our goals.
- **[Administration](../administration/css.md)**: Carry out ongoing organizational tasks that are needed to keep 2i2c running on a daily basis.

## Cross-functional teams

Cross-functional teams consist of team members from various functional areas, and are organized around a specific _goal, service, or product_.
Teams should generally have members with the right skills and authority to accomplish the entirety of the team's goal.
They might be temporary or semi-permanent.

Teams often **share a backlog** that describes their goals and work items, and may also **share a project manager** that oversees coordination and execution of work.

They also often **have team meetings** to facilitate discussion and information flow across functional areas.

There are two main teams within 2i2c, both revolving around major aspects of our Managed Hubs Service:

- **Product and Engineering**: Goal is to design, develop, and improve the Managed JupyterHub Service technology and end-user experience.
- **Community and Partnerships**: Goal is to cultivate relationships with new partnership communities, support and engage with our active partnerships, and use these relationships to feed into 2i2c's sustainability model.

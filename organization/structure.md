# Organizational structure

:::{note}
This page is a work-in-progress as we define the major organizational areas of 2i2c.
Some links might be missing or in-the-works!
:::

This section describes the major structure of 2i2c and how it is broken into functional groups and teams.
Note that 2i2c is a young and small organization, so many areas have a small number (or nobody) dedicated to work within them.
We nonetheless document these structures to understand how our work and responsibilities are divided, and to provide a roadmap for new hires and division of labor.

(structure:fiscal-sponsor)=
## Fiscal sponsorship

2i2c is a [fiscally sponsored project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_sponsorship) of {term}`Code for Science and Society`, a US 501(c)(3) public charity[^icsi].

[^icsi]: It was originally founded as a project of the {term}`International Computer Science Institute`.

## Organization-wide areas

The following areas apply across the entire organization.
They are led by the {role}`Executive Director` and responsibility is delegated to a variety of team members across the organization.

- **[Operations](../operations/index.md)**: Oversees our systems for coordination, planning, and executing our work according to our goals.
- **[People group](../people/index.md)**: Policies and practices for personnel, hiring, salaries, benefits, and time off.
- **[Open Source](../open-source/index.md)**: Our upstream and open source engagement strategy to ensure we have healthy relationships with communities we rely on.
- **[Finance](../finance/index.md)**: Our accounting and financial systems and strategy.
- **[Communication](../communication/index.md)**: Strategy and practices for communicating 2i2c's impact and operations with external communities.
- **[Administration](../administration/index.md)**: Carry out ongoing organizational tasks that are needed to keep 2i2c running on a daily basis.

## Functional areas

Functional areas are organized around _responsibilities, skills, and career tracks_.
They have dedicated leads that are defined in the **Structure and roles** section of each area.

Reporting lines are within a functional area, meaning that team members should report to somebody that has held a similar job in the past.


- **[Engineering](../engineering/structure.md)**: Develop and operate our technical and cloud infrastructure, to ensure that it is reliable and scalable.
- **[Product](../product/structure.md)**: Understand the perspective of our partner communities and guide the evolution of our infrastructure and services, in order to ensure they have a positive impact.
- **[Community](../community/structure.md)**: Guide and support the partner communities that we serve, to help them utilize our infrastructure in a way that aligns with 2i2c's mission.
- **[Partnerships](../partnerships/structure.md)**: Identify opportunities for impact, cultivate new relationships, and oversee our sustainability plan to ensure that we have sustainable and scalable impact.

## Cross-functional teams

Cross-functional teams consist of team members from various functional areas, and are organized around a specific _goal, service, or product_.
Teams should generally have members with the right skills and authority to accomplish the entirety of the team's goal.
They might be temporary or semi-permanent.

Teams often **share a backlog** that describes their goals and work items, and may also **share a project manager** that oversees coordination and execution of work.

They also often **have team meetings** to facilitate discussion and information flow across functional areas.

There are two main teams within 2i2c, both revolving around major aspects of our Managed Hubs Service:

- **Area leads**: Goal is to align on our major goals, strategy, and operations across the leaders of each functional area.
- **Product and Engineering**: Goal is to design, develop, and improve the Managed JupyterHub Service technology and end-user experience.
- **Community and Partnerships**: Goal is to cultivate relationships with new partnership communities, support and engage with our active partnerships, and use these relationships to feed into 2i2c's sustainability model.

## Steering Council

The Steering Council defines the mission, vision, and values of 2i2c.
It also provides oversight to the Executive Director.

It has a more unique structure and role within 2i2c, and is documented at the link below.

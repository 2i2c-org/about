# Principles of decision making

Here is a brief guide to how we make decisions across organizational areas[^1].
It describes the principles that we try to follow, as opposed to the specific mechanisms for decision-making.

[^1]: This is partially inspired by [JupyterHub's pull request workflow](https://jupyterhub-team-compass.readthedocs.io/en/latest/practices/pull_requests.html#principles-to-follow).

## The Team Compass is the Source of Truth

Organizational policy of 2i2c is defined by the content in this Team Compass.
If there are conflicting pieces of information, then the version in the Team Compass takes precedence.
The Team Compass may also delegate Source of Truth status to another location (and often does), but this should be explicitly documented here.

See [](../operations/team-compass.md) for more information about our team compass.

## Default to open

Decision making and discussion processes should be transparent and accessible to the external world.
We should strive for communicating in open spaces that are accessible to those outside of 2i2c.

However, we may _intentionally decide not to discuss certain topics in the open_.
For example, topics that are only relevant for our team, sensitive discussions about external entities, or particularly sensitive topics.
This is fine and encouraged, especially if it will make team members feel safer discussing honestly and openly.
The important thing is that we work in the open by default, and that we're thoughtful about closing off our processes.

(governance:decide-near-action)=
## Decide near the action

Generally speaking, we try to push decision-making authority as close to the action as possible.
We want to empower people to feel comfident in moving forward according to their best judgment, and under the assumption that they will act in accordance with our values and our goals.
We avoid processes that require approvals from many parts of the organization unless it is crucial to have input from these areas.

## Make a proposal and make it accessible

Most actions require context, discussion, and a proposed plan of action.
These should be in a _written_ space that is accessible to the entire organization[^sensitive] and doesn't require specialized skillsets that only a subset of the organization might have.
Generally speaking, **GitHub Issues** or **Google Docs** are where proposals are originally written.

At a minimum, proposals should **describe the problem**, **propose a solution**, and the **rationale for the proposed solution**.
Try keeping your proposal relatively simple and avoid using complex or specialized language so that others can understand it more easily.

[^sensitive]: Unless we are discussing sensitive topics that _must_ restrict who has access to discussion.

## Include others in discussion

Invite discussion from others across 2i2c, and especially from other team leads.
Our goal is to ensure that representation from each part of 2i2c has a chance to be heard, and that we allow the perspective of others to refine and improve our decision-making.

If a discussion is complex or potentially sensitive, make space in [one of our content meetings](meetings:content-meetings) to discuss synchronously.

(governance:consent)=
## Strive for consensus, decide with consent

We strive for consensus across all of the areas of 2i2c, and discussions should focus on arriving at a plan that we are all excited about.
However, we recognize that this is often difficult in the face of complex and sometimes conflicting needs and plans.
If it is not clear that we will reach consensus, follow **a consent-based decision-making process**[^consent-decision-making].
Ensure that nobody has major objections rather than finding the perfect solution for everybody.
Don't block one another's proposals just because it is not perfect.

[^consent-decision-making]: Here are some helpful resources for more information about consent-based decision-making.

    - A short primer: https://thedecider.app/consent-decision-making
    - A more in-depth discussion: https://sociocracyforall.org/consent-decision-making/
    - A well-known technical proposal on "Consent via humming": https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7282

**On tie breakers**.
If there are still major objections to a proposal, but we must nonetheless take action, we should give somebody the authority to make a decision in order to move forward.
Who this person is depends on the decision that is being made.
If it's a decision within a team, then this is a **Team Lead**.
If it's a decision across the organization, then this is **the Executive Director**.
This should happen _rarely_, but it is crucial for moving forward.

## Default to action

As a general rule, we trust one another to make the right decision in the face of uncertainty.
It is crucial that we are inclusive of team members and respectful of their perspectives, but we also recognize that a fully decentralized team must be able to take action without getting bogged down.
Use your best judgment about whether to intentionally hold off on moving forward until more people have given input.
The more complex or sensitive, the more time should be given to discussion and inclusive feedback.
But do not fault one another for taking action and trying to make the right decisions - we can always roll a decision back if we think it was not correct.

We recognize that this may feel intention with the sections listed above around having open proposals and discussion.
There's an inherent tension to making decisions quickly and making them inclusively.
We trust our team to use their best judgment in moving forward versus slowing down to get feedback from others.

## If it isn't written, it doesn't exist

If a decision is made, then it must be encoded somewhere that can be accessed asynchronously.
This should be someplace that is both **discoverable** and **glanceable**, and doesn't require extensive digging and searching.
Usually, this means it must be written **in our Team Compass** or in a GitHub issue.
**The decision has not yet been made until it is written down**.

# Leadership workflow

This section describes how our leadership team carries out its planning and day-to-day work.

## Overview

The "organization-wide" team is a bit different than most other 2i2c teams.
It has a much broader scope (the entire organization), but focuses its efforts on major cross-functional items, or high-level priorities to track over time.

## Goals

The goal of our organizational leadership workflow is to:

- Align on the strategy for 2i2c and our major objectives for accomplishing that strategy.
- Align on the highest priorities in each functional area.
- Share information across functional areas and integrate them into our planning and prioritization.
- Oversee our daily workflow for creating strategy, policy, and structure for 2i2c as an organization.

## Meetings

(organization:meeting-strategy)=
### Content meeting - Organizational strategy

It is led by the **`Executive Director`**.

## Backlog

We have a backlog dedicated to tracking two kinds of information across the organization.
They are split across two different views of the same GitHub Projects board:

- [**Priorities in each functional area**](https://github.com/orgs/2i2c-org/projects/34/views/7) contains the most important priorities in each functional area.
- [**Organizational deliverables and tasks**](https://github.com/orgs/2i2c-org/projects/34/views/8) contains all active work items for the organization. These are generally carried out by leadership at 2i2c. This is similar to the team backlogs used elsewhere in 2i2c.

## Slack channels

- [`#team-leads`](https://2i2c.slack.com/archives/C047H7W78M6): For quick and/or information conversation around organizational strategy and policy.

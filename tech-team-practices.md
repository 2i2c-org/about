# Tech team internal coordination process

As a totally distributed team, it is important to have team practices that give one another insight into what we're working on, identify opportunities to collaborate, and un-block one another. This page describes some of the practices that we adopt towards these goals.

## Our goals

Here are the goals we optimize for in organizing our team work practices.

- Give team members insight into what one another is working on
- Provide some social accountability to get stuff done
- Look for opportunities to work together and/or support one another's work
- Look for opportunities to help one another get stuff done faster or more effectively
- Do this with high efficiency so that people can quickly get on the same page and focus efforts around decision-making and collaboration
- Do all of this in a ðŸ’¯ remote-friendly way since we are split across many different time-zones.

## Defining our active projects and to-do items

**Active projects list**: The 2i2c handbook has [a projects page](https://2i2c.org/handbook/projects/) that has details about major projects that we run at 2i2c. We use this as {term}`Source of Truth` for the major projects that we are working on, and this can be a combination of development-focused things and higher-level project-focused things. These projects should contain links to the location that daily "project management" and goal-setting are happening.

**Per-project to-dos and conversation**: Generally speaking specific projects will have their own place for team conversation, to-do items, and strategy. This is generally *not* in the 2i2c handbook, but there should always be links and references in the handbook that points somebody in the right direction.

**Discussion around team practices**: For discussion around strategy that doesn't have a natural place elsewhere, we use `handbook` issues and PRs. If an issue, it should be actionable (and "closeable"), generally in a way that results in a change to the handbook. If a PR, it should be a proposal to change the handbook and thus update some strategic information in there.

## Bi-weekly team syncs

Every two weeks we synchronize our team goals and practices. Here's how to conduct a team sync.

1. **Create an issue in `handbook/`**. This is where we'll keep track of the "to-do" for the team sync.
2. **Clean up [the HackMD](https://hackmd.io/i2Siurp1TkmPYgn3ZgxFQw?both) for the sync**. We'll use [this HackMD](https://hackmd.io/i2Siurp1TkmPYgn3ZgxFQw?both) to run the team sync. At the top is a set of questions to answer, and we can We'll initially use the HackMD to give responses. You can create it from the following template:
3. **Team members give their responses**. You can copy/paste the template, and then give your responses below. You shouldn't feel forced to add content if you can't think of anything, use it as much as is useful. 
4. **We'll leave the HackMD open for 48hrs**, not counting weekends or holidays. That should give enough time for those of us across many time zones to respond.
5. **Merge into the [dev team sync notes](team/meetings/index.md)**. This is where we'll store our sync notes for each team sync, and refer to them later.

## What about stuff that shouldn't be public?

For technical and infrastructure development, we should default to public. However, if something should *not* be public, mark it as-such in the HackMD and it won't be included in the public notes.

## Inspiration

This is a similar process as the one followed in the **jupyterhub `team-compass`**. It also follows a similar model to how [`gitlab` uses their handbook](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/).

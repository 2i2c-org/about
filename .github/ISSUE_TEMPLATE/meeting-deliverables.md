# 2i2c Deliverables Review meeting

This is a one-hour recurring meeting every two weeks on **Monday at 8AM Pacific time** (here's [**a timezone converter**](https://arewemeetingyet.com/Los%20Angeles/2000-01-01/08:00/2i2c%20Team%20Meeting#eyJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL2hhY2ttZC5pby9ZNVNCTXhWN1I2Q01xemVUWGdtNWtBIn0=), ignore the date!).

Our goal is to synchronize the team on the most important things to work on, and to divide work between one another so we know what to work on next.

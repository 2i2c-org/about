This issue transitions a support steward role to a new team member!
We transition support steward roles every two weeks.
The support steward rotates alphabetically through the 2i2c Engineering Team. Here's a [list of team members for support steward rotation](https://team-compass.2i2c.org/en/latest/about/team.html#open-infrastructure-team).

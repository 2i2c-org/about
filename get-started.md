# Get started at 2i2c

This is a guide and checklist for new team members of 2i2c to get oriented, and to make sure that you're set up with all the resources you need to start contributing!

:::{admonition} A note about staff vs. non-staff
The information here (and in the Team Compass) applies to anybody that is "on the 2i2c team".
That means both staff at CS&S, as well as non-staff team members that may work in other institutions.
However, there may be some steps here that are only relevant to CS&S staff.

## Onboarding process

New 2i2c team members are onboarded in order to make sure that the following conditions are met:

- They know where to look for certain information
- They have access to all of the accounts and services we use
- They feel welcome and excited to be a part of the team
- They have an understanding of what 2i2c is currently up to
- They have enough information to get started

When a new team member joins, follow these two steps first:

1. **Identify an Onboarding Champion**. This is somebody that will help guide the onboarding process for our new team member.
   Their job is to carry out the process described in the onboarding issue template.
2. **Open an onboarding issue in the Team Compass**. 
   This issue will track the onboarding process, and serves as the {term}`Source of Truth` for steps to take in order to onboard a new team member.

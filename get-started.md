## Navigating the team compass

This repository acts as a knowledge base and a "Source of Truth" for everything at 2i2c.
It is regularly updated as our team processes, structure, and information changes.
There is a *lot* of information in the team compass, so here is a quick primer on where to look next.

To **get started with the 2i2c Team**, see the sections below:

- [](practices/info-location.md) - an overview of where different kinds of information is stored for 2i2c (e.g., what things are stored in Google Drive, what things in GitHub, etc)
- [](practices/expectations.md) - what practices you are expected to abide by while working with the 2i2c team.
- [](practices/communication.md) - the various channels that the 2i2c teams use for communication, and what kinds of conversation happens in each channel.
- [](practices/coordination.md) - the team workflow that we use in carrying out projects and daily activities.
- [](practices/team-compass.md) - how to update the team compass itself.

In addition, the other sections on this page contain pointers to other useful sources of information for 2i2c.

## Onboarding process

New 2i2c team members are onboarded in order to make sure that the following conditions are met:

- They know where to look for certain information
- They feel welcome and excited to be a part of the team
- They have an understanding of what 2i2c is currently up to
- They have enough information to get started

When a new team member joins, follow these two steps first:

1. Identify an **Onboarding Champion**. This is somebody that will help guide the onboarding process for our new team member.
   Their job is to carry out the process described in the onboarding issue template.
2. [Open an issue in the Team Compass](https://github.com/2i2c-org/team-compass/issues/new/choose). Choose the "Onboard a new team member" template.
   This issue will track the onboarding process, and will provide steps to take in order to onboard our new team member.

The following sections describe some things that should be met in order to onboard somebody new.

## Accounts that should be created

- **A GMail address**. You can use this to access information in the 2i2c drive, as well as various online services that we use such as cloud engines. You can sign in to your email address at gmail.com (it behaves like a Google account).
- **A Slack account**. In addition to GMail, 2i2c also uses Slack to have informal or synchronous communication.

## Accounts you should have access to

- **Google Drive**. Your 2i2c email address will get you access to a Google Drive that contains documents, brainstorms, and other assets that aren't fit for the 2i2c Team Compass. You can log into the Google Drive by going to `drive.google.com` and adding a new account using your `@2i2c.org` address and password.

- **GitHub Access**. 2i2c has a few GitHub repositories. You should have membership in the `2i2c-org` GitHub organization and write access to its repositories. Check that this is the case and, if not, ask for access in the Slack.

- **NameCheap Access**. 2i2c runs much of its cloud infrastructure at custom URLs created for the target institution. In order to ensure you have the ability to create new URLs, you should have access to the 2i2c NameCheap account. If not, ask for access in the Slack.

- **Cloud Accounts**. 2i2c has a number of cloud accounts that it uses to create and operate its infrastructure. You should have access to the cloud accounts for any projects that you expect to work on. This includes Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, and Amazon Web Services. The specific project might depend on what youâ€™re working on, so check with the team to make sure you have the right access.

## What are we working on right now?

The [2i2c team coordination page](practices/coordination.md) has information about our daily workflow.
You can use this to begin participating in our daily activities and find out what everyone is working on.

## What major projects is 2i2c working on?

Check out the [projects page](reference/projects.md) for more information about the projects that 2i2c is working on.

## Tips for working remotely

2i2c is a remote-first organization, and believes strongly in following practices that are inclusive, participatory, and collaborative. It has team members spread out over many time zones working on a variety of projects. There are many guides and tips for working remotely[^remote-work1], and we've tried to distill a few key components for our workflows:

1. **Have a single source of truth**. For any information or projects in 2i2c, there should be one source of truth. Any conflicting information will defer to this source of truth, and it should be updated first and often. The default source of truth is this team compass, unless otherwise specified.

2. **Document everything**. Documentation is the most important tool for coordinating and distributing information across remote teams. It is crucial that 2i2c team members document all relevant information about their projects, what they are working on, etc.

3. **Broadcast updates in multiple places**. Different people have different preferred methods of engagement and communication on 2i2c projects. For this reason, don't assume that posting an update or question in a single location will reach everybody that you wish to reach. Do not hesitate to post questions or ask for feedback in multiple places (e.g., GitHub, Slack, or even email). However, try to keep information in a single place to have a single source of truth.

4. **Update often**. Err on the side of updating the team more often than not.  Nobody should be surprised when something gets done - especially nothing major. Your work should be as transparent to others as possible!

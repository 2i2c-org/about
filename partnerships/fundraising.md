# Fundraising strategy

:::{admonition} Our funding goal for 2024
_By **August 7th 2024**…_

We have a **projected** expected monthly revenue of $180,000 in October 2024.

## Primary funding strategy

This is the primary funding strategy that will guide Partnerships and Engineering through October 2024:

:::{epigraph}
Raise funding for _networks_ of communities that share the same workflows, domains, or impact.
:::

Here's a rough idea for how to operationalize this strategy:

1. Identify collections of communities that share similar goals or workflows.
2. Identify community leaders that can collaborate with us on a proposal.
3. Identify funders that care about the outcomes from these communities.
4. Raise funds for the entire network at-once.

This strikes a balance between "scalable and very simple hubs" (which require a lot of administrative toil) and "fully bespoke hubs" (which are expensive and unscalable). By using a single funding contract to serve many communities, we can reduce the amount of sales and contracting toil for each community. This will let us raise funds more quickly, and focus more of our time on delivering service.

### Engineering tactics

- **Define a list of hub "ingredients" that we can deploy.** These ingredients give our Partnerships teams options for what functionality they can offer _out-of-the-box_.
- **Make it efficient to deploy these quickly for a hub.** This will let the Partnerships team be agile in responding to opportunities from the market.

### Partnership creation tactics

- **Identify qualified networks of communities.** These communities share workflows and interests, and would be well-served by a hub "distribution" for them.
  See [](#qualifying-communities) for guidelines on how to qualify them.
- **Define a mission / impact statement for the network.** What is the collective problem that connects these communities?
- **Define one to three champions for the network.** These will be leaders that we can partner with in helping grow the community and potentially fundraise.
- **Identify a funder to fund this mission.** Fund the entire group at once from a funder (foundation, agency, large buyer, etc).
- **Develop and deliver service once funding arrives.** Once contracts begin, we will have time to develop the capabilities needed to deliver hub service, and identify communities to use the service.


### Community success tactics

- **Use hub ingredients to define a base hub for the network.** Do this in collaboration with hub champions. This provides the basic hub that any community in the network will get.
- **Offer learning material for workflows on a hub network.** This gives community leaders a starting point for how to make the hub theirs and encourage specific workflows around it.
- **Develop community leaders through guidance and support.** Work with community leaders throughout the project so that they are equipped to guide their communities.

## Qualifying a network of communities

The following guidelines help us identify potential networks of communities that are a good fit for this network.
Use this information to decide if it is worth investing more time into a community network.

+ A _community_ is a group of 10 to 1000 people. (Example: People that work in the engine room on a cruise ship.)
+ A _prospective community_ is a community with the potential to benefit from cloud-hosted interactive computing and open science social innovation. (Example: People who want to understand the urban <> ecology interactions in estuaries and marshes in San Francisco bay.)
+ A _qualified prospective community_ is a prospective community 2i2c has more fully described by filling out the community's qualification metadata:

| Name    | Value                                                                                                                  |

| Mission      | What is the mission of the statement for this community?<br>What **value** does the community seek?                                                  |
| Leadership   | Who is the champion for this community?<br>Is there a person who can serve as technical lead?<br>What is the leadership capacity for this community? |

| Funder       | What organization has funded or is likely to fund this community?                                                                                    |

## Secondary strategies

These are opportunities to pursue only if there’s a natural opportunity.

**Development-focused grants.** These are grants designed to expand technical capabilities of some aspect of our hubs service. We should only pursue them if they are (1) Substantial in size, (2) Clearly aligned with our product strategy.

**Strategic and core support grants.** This is a 2i2c-wide grant that funds our vision and intended impact, and is not attached to any specific service. It funds the core roles needed to execute on our mission, and is similar to a "Series A" round of funding for a non-profit.

## Appendix: Options available to us

- **Simple hubs that scale to many hundreds of communities.** These require extreme growth to achieve sustainability. Small contracts, large N of contracts.
- **Complex hubs that scale to tens of communities within a domain.** These build on a base hub deployment, with predefined options for customization to a specific use-case. Medium contracts, medium N of contracts.
- **Fully bespoke hubs.** that require full customization and are very expensive. Large contracts, low N of contracts.

# Communication channels

## Partnerships e-mail address

We use a [shared e-mail inbox](org:communication:shared-email) called `partnerships@2i2c.org` to collect any inbound communication from those that wish to partner with 2i2c.

It is attached to the `2i2c Partnerships` Google Group.

Access is also shared with {term}`CS&S` so that they have context for any handoffs to invoicing and administration.

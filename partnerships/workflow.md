## Standard Operating Procedures for Partnerships Business

2i2c provides interactive computing services to partner communities. These notes describe standard operating procedures used by 2i2c and CS&S to establish and cultivate business relationships with partner communities. The workflows orchestrate information exchanges (meetings, emails, negotiations) between 2i2c/CS&S and partners or prospective partners and produce documents (service agreements, quotes, statements of work, renewal notices, invoices, service descriptions, receipts).  

The procedures use Google Drive, Freshdesk, GitHub, and AirTable.

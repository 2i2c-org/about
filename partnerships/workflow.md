## Standard Operating Procedures for Partnerships Business

2i2c provides interactive computing services to partner communities. These notes describe standard operating procedures used by 2i2c and CS&S to establish and cultivate business relationships with partner communities. The workflows orchestrate information exchanges (meetings, emails, negotiations) between 2i2c/CS&S and partners or prospective partners and produce documents (service agreements, quotes, statements of work, renewal notices, invoices, service descriptions, receipts).  

### Arc of Partnership Formation

The procedures describe action sequences our team will carry out as expression of interest in 2i2c evolves through phases Lead --> Prospect --> Partner: 

+ A _Lead_ is a contact with possible interest in a partnership with 2i2c. A lead is _qualified_ when the contact is connected to an organization that can enter agreements with CS&S/2i2c. 2i2c's main goal during the _lead phase_ is to empower the lead to decide whether to partner with 2i2c. The lead phase ends with a "verbal close" `no` or advances to the next phase with a `yes`. 
+ A qualified lead becomes a _Prospect_ after a "verbal close" `yes` to form a partnership. The _prospect phase_ involves two parallel activities: business terms of the partnership are negotiated in the service agreement and accompanying documents; technical exchanges specify details and the requested services are deployed. The prospect phase ends with an "executed close" when the service agreement is fully signed by all parties in the partnership. 
+ A _Partner_ is an organization that has a signed agreement with 2i2c/CS&S.

### Lead Phase Procedures

#### SOP: Hail the Lead

A contact(s) (with **email address(es)**) has possible interest in a partnership with 2i2c.

1. Send Freshdesk >> Canned Messge >> "Hail the Lead" to contact emails.
2. Use `From`: partnerships@
3. Attach: service description
4. Include: meeting invitation with 30 minute Calendly link

#### SOP: Prep for First Meeting with Lead

A lead confirmed an upcoming meeting with 2i2c. 

1. 2i2c specifies that the lead will be tracked under "PartnerX" (usually the name of the partner organization)
2. Create PartnerX folder inside 2i2c Team Drive >> Partnerships >> Agreements
3. Copy 2i2c Team Drive >> Partnerships >> Templates >> [Template] Running Notes into PartnerX folder.
4. Specialize Running Notes Template for PartnerX (rename following pattern, insert top matter)
5. Set sharing of Running Notes (with editor rights) with lead contacts (meeting participants) 
6. Canned message inviting collaboration in Running Notes

> Ideally? Can we send link to shared running notes in automated meeting confirmation messages sent by calendly?

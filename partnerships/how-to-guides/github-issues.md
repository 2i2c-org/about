# How do I open a GitHub issue with Engineering?

This page describes how you can open a general GitHub issue with the {team}`Engineering Team`, for example, to report a failing CI workflow, ask for a feature enhancement or even deploy a new Hub. In this guide, we will be using the {doc}`../../projects/managed-hubs/showcase-hub` as our example GitHub repo.

## Steps

1. Navigate to the Community Showcase [GitHub repo](https://github.com/2i2c-org/community-showcase).
2. Under the Issues tab, click **New issue**.

```

3. If applicable, select the most appropriate GitHub  (or open a blank issue). In this example, we use the ðŸ’¡ **General Issue** template.

4. Fill out the template

    - Populate the text input fields. Try to be concise while providing as much technical detail as you can. For complicated issues, providing a Minimal Working Example and relevant error messages from output logs where possible is a great help. Use code blocks and avoid pasting screenshots of code.
    - Use the **Assignees** field on the right-hand side to assign it to **@damianavila**, {role}`Engineering Manager`, to be triaged.
    - In the **Labels** field on the right-hand side, choose *one* relevant issue type: {bdg-info}`type: enhancement`, {bdg-info}`type: bug`, or {bdg-info}`type: task`.
    - Add the **Engineering and Product Backlog** board to the *Projects* field on the right-hand side.

# Using FreshDesk

We [use FreshDesk](support:freshdesk) as part of our support processes.
This service has its own functionality and quirks, and this page is a place to document some common actions we must take.

## Add a footer to all replies

Sometimes it is useful to auto-add a footer to all support ticket responses.
This will come pre-populated in our response, and we can then add more text as we wish.
This is useful for things like [notifying communities about expected downtime](time-off:annual-expected).

[Here's the FreshDesk page on adding a footer](https://support.freshdesk.com/en/support/solutions/articles/196889-i-want-to-insert-a-footer-into-all-my-replies-how-do-i-do-this-).
And a quick summary:

1. Go to `Admin` > `Workflows` > `Email Notifications`.
2. Click on the `Templates` tab > `Agent Reply Template`.
3. Edit the form in order to add the text you'd like.

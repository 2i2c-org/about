# Strategy and goals

Our Strategic Plan is a combination of active and aspirational priorities that help us get closer to achieving our organizational mission. These are broken down into **strategic goals and objects for each**. The [major projects of 2i2c](../projects/index.md) should all feed into this strategy.

Currently, 2i2c's Strategic Plan consists of a 1-year "bootstrap strategy".
Our primary goal is to build a foundation for 2i2c and clarify out strategy and objectives for the coming years.
This plan was created by the Founding Team of 2i2c [and is located here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13uxWKWMMAdvM-knC5fMOj8tP_HQVvijIIE9jZgTItX4/edit?usp=sharing).
This page is a summary and synthesis of the ideas in that document.

The following objectives should be accomplished by **October of 2021**.

## Build a foundation for 2i2c's operations

**Rationale:**

2i2c needs an organizational home, structure, and governing body in order to begin exploring how it can best-accomplish its mission.
It also needs resources that can fund people's time to begin work.
 
**Objectives:**

- 2i2c has an organizational home that can sign contracts, hold liability, and administer our operations.
- 2i2c has a governing body and rules for governance.
- 2i2c has organizational funding for core staff for at least a year.
- 2i2c has hired core staff for its first year of operations
- 2i2c has organizational structure to handle both its engineering and the business operations.
- 2i2c has a clearly-defined Mission, Vision, and Values.
- 2i2c has a strategic plan for the next 1-3 years.

## Launch the Managed JupyterHubs pilot

**Rationale:**

One of 2i2c's goals is to serve the research and education community through Managed Services that utilize infrastructure for interactive computing.
It will take some exploration and learning to understand how to best-design these services.
As a start, we wish to launch a **Managed JupyterHubs** service, and will begin with a pilot to explore this model.
 
**Objectives:**

- 2i2c manages JupyterHubs for at least two institutions.
- 2i2c manages more lightweight, community-specific JupyterHubs for several smaller groups in research and education.
- 2i2c manages a "generic" JupyterHub that is not tied to any single institution or group.
- 2i2c has a beta-level sustainability model for the first iteration of our Collaborative JupyterHub Service.
- 2i2c has built relationships with cloud providers that facilitate our ability to serve these hubs to our users.

## Launch major collaborations

**Rationale:**

2i2c wishes to conduct focused development in collaboration with others in research and education.
We wish to engage in several major projects that will support infrastructure that aligns with our mission, and that also feeds into our Collaborative JupyterHub Service.

**Objectives:**

- 2i2c has launched a project around serving educational hub infrastructure to under-served educational institutions.
- 2i2c has launched a project to provide infrastructure development and support for the earth sciences community.
- 2i2c has made significant contributions across several open source communities that are related to the infrastructure it serves.

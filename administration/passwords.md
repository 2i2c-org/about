# Shared bitwarden account

We use [bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/) to share passwords and secrets across the team.
This is done via **a bitwarden organization** that all team members have access to.
You can use this to fill in password fields for shared accounts, as well as to share credentials securely across the team.

Any new team members should have access to this organization.

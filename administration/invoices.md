# Send invoices to CS&S

This page describes the process for sending invoices to our fiscal sponsor, {term}`Code for Science and Society`.

This includes any team members that are paid off of fixed-term contracts and submit monthly invoices for their work.

1. **Read the CS&S invoicing instructions**. CS&S [has instructions to invoice here](https://www.codeforsociety.org/resources/getting-paid-by-css).
   This is what you'll follow.
2. **Prepare an invoice**. If you do not have one, [here is a template to get you started](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17aTwJkmYFXwqHa2QjYsy81hEXq64yfmo5g1SCGE6aK4/edit?usp=sharing).
3. **Confirm your grant code**. You will need to supply a **grant code** for your invoice.
   See [](reimburse:grant-code).
4. **Send it to [`bills@codeforsociety.org`](mailto:bills@codeforsociety.org) and [`admin@2i2c.org`](mailto:admin@2i2c.org)**.
   These are both organizational accounts to track the invoices and ensure visibility across the organization.
5. **Do not hesitate to ask about the status of your invoice**.
   The above steps should be all you need to do, but do not hesitate to reach out again if things seem to be going slow.

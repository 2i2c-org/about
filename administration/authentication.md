# Authentication accounts for hubs

This page describes the accounts that we use for authentication in our JupyterHubs.

## CILogon

We have an annual [**Essential Service** membership with CILogon](https://www.cilogon.org/subscribe).
This allows us to use the CILogon service for authenticating users on our hubs.
See [the `infrastructure/` docs](infra:hub-deployment-guide/configure-auth/cilogon) for more information.

## Auth0

We used to use [a 2i2c account with `Auth0`](https://manage.auth0.com/dashboard/us/2i2c/) for authenticating users on hubs.
We ended our use of `Auth0` in April 2023 and no longer pay for a subscription, but keep this account in case we need it in the future.

# Zoom accounts

We have a shared Zoom account that we can use to schedule meetings across team members.

## Access the zoom account

We access the zoom account via [a shared Google Workspace group username](google-workspace.md).
To do so, log in with these credentials:

- **username**: `hello@2i2c.org`.
- **password**: See [](account:bitwarden).

You may be prompted to type in a one-time code that will be sent to `hello@2i2c.org`.

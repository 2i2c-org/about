## Expensify

Our fiscal sponsor, {term}`CS&S`, uses [an Expensify service](https://www.expensify.com/inbox) to handle all of our project billing and connect it with our grants.

Only two people are able to be managers on this account, currently these are:

- Chris Holdgraf
- Jim Colliander

If you'd like access to our Expensify account or need to use it, reach out to one of these people.

### Expensify credit card

For recurring payments for services, or major organizational expenses, we have an Credit card that is directly linked to our Expensify account.
This allows us to pay directly out of our organizational funds without requiring a team member to pay up-front.

## Reimbursement

### What can be reimbursed?

We reimburse team members that take on expenses as part of doing their work, provided that these expenses are aligned with the mission and goals of 2i2c.
Any reimbursement request will need to be approved by either {term}`CS&S` or 2i2c's Executive Director.

A good rule of thumb is to ask before you purchase something that you plan to reimburse in the future.
As we understand our regular costs we will build a more sophisticated policy for what kinds of things can be reimbursed.

Currently, these are the expenses that we regularly reimburse:

- Monthly / annual fees for online services that are used across the entire 2i2c team.
- Cloud infrastructure costs incurred as part of our services.
- Conference travel / registration for conferences that we agree are in-scope for 2i2c's attendance.
- Personal development / training for skills that are directly related to team responsibilities.
- Infrequent equipment purchases for team members (computers, desks, etc) provided they are within a reasonable spend amount.

### Reimbursement process

We do all of our reimbursements via our fiscal sponsor, {term}`CS&S`.
Here is the process that we follow:

- **For employees**: Submit reimbursements via [Expensify](admin:expensify).
- **For contractors**: Submit a separate line item on your monthly invoice, called `Reimbursement - <item>`

For contractors, we also need to include the following language in your contract:

> Expenses: Organization agrees to reimburse Independent Contractor for all expenses reasonably incurred in the performance of the Engagement and approved by Organization in advance, upon presentation of supporting receipts and documentation.

### If you do not wish to pay yourself

If you do not wish to make the payment yourself, we can make a payment with our [Expensify Credit Card](admin:credit-card).
To do this, contact the [Executive Director](titles:exec-dir) or the [Partnerships Lead](titles:partnerships-lead).

# GitHub organization

## Organization plan

We have a **GitHub Team Organization** that is free due to our non-profit status.
[Here's a list of features in GitHub Team status](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/getting-started-with-github/githubs-products#github-team).

We may need to re-apply for membership for this each year.

## Administrator access

Some individuals have `administrator access` to our GitHub organization.
This allows them full control over the organization and its settings (including destructive actions).

We currently do not have a policy for who has administrator access, so ask around if you believe that you need it.
We will define a policy for access in the future.

## Internal teams

[The `2i2c Team` team](https://github.com/orgs/2i2c-org/teams/2i2c-team) is for every staff, steering council, and key collaborator of 2i2c.
It should provide access to all private 2i2c repositories.

In addition, there are several sub-teams underneath `2i2c Team`, grouped by topic area.
Team members are added to one of these teams, and inherit `2i2c Team` status from this.

## External teams

[The `Collaborators` team](https://github.com/orgs/2i2c-org/teams/collaborators) is for **external collaborators** that we would like to officially list in a team.
For example, this is helpful if we want to quickly `@mention` a group of people or control fine-grained permissions of repositories.

This team does not come with any special repository permissions on its own.

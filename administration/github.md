# GitHub organization

## Organization plan

We have a **GitHub Team Organization** that is free due to our non-profit status.
[Here's a list of features in GitHub Team status](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/getting-started-with-github/githubs-products#github-team).

We may need to re-apply for membership for this each year.

## Teams

- [**`@2i2c-team`**](https://github.com/orgs/2i2c-org/teams/2i2c-team).
  For every staff member and key collaborator of 2i2c.
  It should provide access to all private 2i2c repositories.

  In addition, there are several sub-teams underneath `2i2c Team`, grouped by topic area.
  Team members are added to one of these teams, and inherit `2i2c Team` status from this.
- [**`@collaborators`**](https://github.com/orgs/2i2c-org/teams/collaborators).
  For external collaborators that we would like to officially list in a team.
  For example, if we want to quickly `@mention` a group of people or control fine-grained permissions of repositories.

  This team does not come with any special repository permissions on its own.

## Administrator access

Some individuals have `administrator access` to our GitHub organization.
This allows them full control over the organization and its settings (including destructive actions).

We currently do not have a policy for who has administrator access, so ask around if you believe that you need it.
We will define a policy for access in the future.

## Repository access

Members of `@2i2c-team` have access to all 2i2c repositories, including private repositories.
For non-members of this team, access is granted on a repository-by-repository basis.

We do not have a policy for who may access repositories, so use your best judgment.

# CS&S Administration

There are a few ways in which we interact with {term}`Code for Science and Society`.
This page provides an overview.

## CS&S Handbooks

CS&S has two handbooks that have information and policy for the organization.
These apply to anybody that is employed or contracted by 2i2c.
Below are links to each:

- [The CS&S Handbook](https://www.notion.so/CS-S-Handbook-18cd12a6e44c4393857642da6a6b0fdf) is similar to our Team Compass.
- [CS&S Employee Handbook](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LDN8-iSak391uQC5AzvtzD9dIOmfHg8kihwlvzn8Cy8/edit#heading=h.gjdgxs) is more like an employee policy guide.

```{tip}
ðŸ“§ Please avoid emailing individual CS&S email addresses where possible. This ensures CS&S staff have maximum visibility of incoming email addresses and your query may be resolved more quickly as a result.
```

```{role} CS&S Operations
```
## CS&S Operations

To discuss invoices, contracting, etc.
This includes most "administrative actions" that we need help with, such as work with *external parties* regarding onboarding, signatures, invoicing, etc.

E-mail address: **`operations@codeforscience.org`**

```{role} CS&S FSP
```

## CS&S FSP Advisor

For more strategic and programs-level conversations.

E-mail address: **`fsp@codeforscience.org`**.

## CS&S HR

For confidential Human Resources needs.

E-mail address: **`hr@codeforscience.org`**.

## CS&S Bills

For sending invoices. This inbox is automated and not monitored.

E-mail address: **`bills@codeforscience.org`**.

## Google Group

We have a dedicated Google Group and e-mail that we use to provide CS&S team members access to our files.

- **`css-admin@2i2c.org`**

This is because they need visibility into many of our operational information for bookkeeping and accountability purposes.
It contains several administrative and organizational leaders of CS&S.
They are all listed as managers, so can add people on their own.

In Google Drive, you may add the `css-admin@2i2c.org` group to the sharing list for a folder or file and they will have access.

## Asana board

CS&S has an Asana board that they occasionally use to track work items.
You can find it at this link:

[CS&S Asana Board](https://app.asana.com/0/1200569652722016/list).

```{note}
The list above is fairly comprehensive â€“ there is no need to use any other aliases (such as `accounting@codeforscience`, etc.) since they are intended for outgoing use.
```

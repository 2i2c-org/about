# CS&S Administration

There are a few ways in which we interact with {term}`Code for Science and Society`.
This page provides an overview.

## CS&S Handbooks

CS&S has two handbooks that have information and policy for the organization.
These apply to anybody that is employed or contracted by 2i2c.
Below are links to each:

- [The CS&S Handbook](https://www.notion.so/CS-S-Handbook-18cd12a6e44c4393857642da6a6b0fdf) is similar to our Team Compass.
- [CS&S Employee Handbook](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LDN8-iSak391uQC5AzvtzD9dIOmfHg8kihwlvzn8Cy8/edit#heading=h.gjdgxs) is more like an employee policy guide.

## E-mail addresses

CS&S has a few email addresses that they use for different kinds of communication.
The two major addresses are:

- **`operations@codeforscience.org`**: To discuss invoices, contracting, etc.
  This includes most "administrative actions" that we need help with.
- **`fsp@codeforscience.org`**: For more strategic and programs-level conversations.

## Google Group

We have a dedicated Google Group and e-mail that we use to provide CS&S team members access to our files.

- **`css-admin@2i2c.org`**

This is because they need visibility into many of our operational information for bookkeeping and accountability purposes.
It contains several adminsitrative and organizational leaders of CS&S.
They are all listed as managers, so can add people on their own.

In Google Drive, you may add the `css-admin@2i2c.org` group to the sharing list for a folder or file and they will have access.

## Asana board

CS&S has an Asana board that they occasionally use to tack work items.
You can find it at this link:

# Google workspace

We have a Google Workspace account that gives us `@2i2c.org` e-mail addresses with GMail, Google Drive, and a few other services as well.

## Administrator console

We access and configure our account via the [Google Workspaces admin panel at `workspace.google.com`](https://workspace.google.com/).

To access it, click on `Admin Console`.

## Access and permissions

Any team lead should have administrative access to this space - if you don't then please request it and it will be granted.

## Groups and shared e-mails

We use Google Groups to define e-mail inboxes that we share between team members.
We also use this to provide group access to files and folders in our shared Google Drives.

To see a list of all Google Groups at 2i2c:

- Go to [`groups.google.com`](https://groups.google.com/) with your 2i2c account.
- Click on `All groups` to see all groups at 2i2c.

## Add new members

You may add new team members to our Google Workspace account via the `Admin Panel`.
This will give them Google Drive access as well as an `@2i2c.org` account.
However, **we pay monthly for every person-specific e-mail address**.

As a rule of thumb, **any team members of 2i2c get a workspace account**.
In addition, Steering Council members may get an account as well if they wish and if they intend to actively use it.

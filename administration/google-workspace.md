# Google workspace

We have a Google Workspace account that gives us `@2i2c.org` e-mail addresses with GMail, Google Drive, and a few other services as well.

We access and configure our account via the [Google Workspaces admin panel at `workspace.google.com`](https://workspace.google.com/).

To access it, click on `Admin Console`.

## Access and permissions

Any team lead should have administrative access to this space - if you don't then please request it and it will be granted.

## Google groups and e-mails

We use Google Groups to define e-mail inboxes that we share between team members.
We also use this to provide group access to files and folders in our shared Google Drives.
These are documented in the location where it is most-relevant throughout these docs.

## Adding new members

You may add new team members to our Google Workspace account via the `Admin Panel`.
This will give them Google Drive access as well as an `@2i2c.org` account.
However, **we pay monthly for every person-specific e-mail address**.

As a rule of thumb, **any team members of 2i2c get a workspace account**.
In addition, Steering Council members may get an account as well if they wish and if they intend to actively use it.

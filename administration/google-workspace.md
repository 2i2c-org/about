# Google workspace

We have a Google Workspace account that gives us `@2i2c.org` e-mail addresses with GMail, Google Drive, and a few other services as well.

We access and configure our account via the [Google Workspaces admin panel at `workspace.google.com`](https://workspace.google.com/).

To access it, click on `Admin Console`.

## Access and permissions

Any team lead should have administrative access to this space - if you don't then please request it and it will be granted.

## Adding new members

You may add new team members to our Google Workspace account via the `Admin Panel`.
This will give them Google Drive access as well as an `@2i2c.org` account.
However, **we pay monthly for every person-specific e-mail address**.

As a rule of thumb, **any team members of 2i2c get a workspace account**.
In addition, Steering Council members may get an account as well if they wish and if they intend to actively use it.

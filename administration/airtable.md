# AirTable accounts

We use AirTable to track some of our leads, contracts, and invoicing data.
This page covers this account and how to access it.

[Here's a link to our primary AirTable workspace](https://airtable.com/appbjBTRIbgRiElkr).
In addition, there are several bases within this workspace that are described below.

## Log in to our shared account

We have a single account on the "Pro" plan of AirTable.
You can access the account with the username and password.
Here's how to do so:

1. **Ask a team member for the password**. If you'd like access, ask around the team to see who has the password and they can share it with you.
   % TODO: In the future we need a more structured way to share access.
   %   eventually, we'll need to pay for more than one account.
2. **Log in to the account**. Once you do so, you'll have access to the **AirTable bases** under this workspace.

## Base: Invoicing data from CS&S

Our [`Invoices` base](https://airtable.com/appbjBTRIbgRiElkr/tblkmferOITqS2vH8/viwfuamzW4kbaQSSJ) has a record of **every invoice that CS&S has for 2i2c**.
This includes anticipated future invoices and grants.

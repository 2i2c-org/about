# Reimbursements and Ramp

Our fiscal sponsor, {term}`CS&S`, use [a service called Ramp](https://ramp.com/) to handle all of our project billing and connect it with our grants.

If you'd like access to our Ramp account or need to use it, reach out to one of these people.

:::{admonition} You can use the organization credit card
We have an [organizational credit card](admin:credit-card) to purchase things directly with 2i2c funds if you do not wish to file a reimbursement yourself.
To do this, contact the {role}`Executive Director` or the {role}`Partnerships Lead`.
:::

We do all of our reimbursements via our fiscal sponsor, {term}`CS&S`.
There is a different process for employees vs. contractors, see below for more details.


## What can be reimbursed?

We reimburse team members that take on expenses as part of doing their work, provided that these expenses are aligned with the mission and goals of 2i2c.
Any reimbursement request will need to be approved by either {term}`CS&S` or 2i2c's Executive Director.

A good rule of thumb is to ask before you purchase something that you plan to reimburse in the future.
As we understand our regular costs we will build a more sophisticated policy for what kinds of things can be reimbursed.

Currently, these are the expenses that we regularly reimburse:

- Monthly / annual fees for online services that are used across the entire 2i2c team.
- Cloud infrastructure costs incurred as part of our services.
- Conference travel / registration for conferences that we agree are in-scope for 2i2c's attendance.
- Personal development / training for skills that are directly related to team responsibilities.
- Infrequent equipment purchases for team members (computers, desks, etc) provided they are within a reasonable spend amount.

## Reimbursement for employees

If you're an employee, you can request a reimbursement via an invoice.
To do so, see [](invoices.md).

(reimbursements:contractors)=
## Reimbursement for contractors

To reimburse expenses as a contractor, **submit a separate line item on your monthly invoice**, called `Reimbursement - <item>`.

See [](invoices.md) for instructions on how to submit an invoice.

:::{admonition} This must be written into your contract
We need to include the following language in your contract to make this legal:

> Expenses: Organization agrees to reimburse Independent Contractor for all expenses reasonably incurred in the performance of the Engagement and approved by Organization in advance, upon presentation of supporting receipts and documentation.

## Reimbursement for our 2i2c credit card

If you purchase something with our 2i2c credit card, the transaction will show up in Ramp.
Someone with **Administrator privileges** in [our Ramp account](https://app.ramp.com/business-overview) must approve any transactions that are made with Ramp.
Here is the process that we follow for this:

1. Go to [the Ramp inbox](https://app.ramp.com/inbox). This should list any items that need action from you or others.
2. If it is empty, then there's nothing to do!
3. If it has items for Review, click on each one and follow the prompts to include any important missing information.

### Send receipts to Ramp via e-mail

Ramp has the ability to **automatically scan receipts via e-mail and attach them to purchases**.
This can drastically speed up the process of approving recurring transactions.

- Make a purchase with our Ramp.com card.
- Use an e-mail that is attached to our ramp.com account.
- Receive an e-mail with a receipt (e.g. as an attached PDF, or in-line text).
- Forward the e-mail to `receipts@ramp.com`.

Ramp should scan the e-mail and automatically attach the receipt to the proper expense.
See [the Ramp receipt detection documentation](https://support.ramp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360042588454-Submitting-Receipts-Memos) for more details.

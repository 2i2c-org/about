# Structure and responsibilities

This page describes the structure and roles of our Operations Team.

## Responsibilities

2i2c's Operations team is responsible for defining and overseeing our systems for work coordination, planning, and accountability.

Below are major areas of responsibility.

### Define systems and processes for coordination

- Define our meeting and coordination systems for planning our work.
- Define systems for sharing information between team members.

### Refine work items to be actionable and clear

- Translate strategic priorities and deliverables into actionable work items.
- Ensure that our work items have a clear scope and path forward for completion.
- Communicate with teams (e.g. `Product and Engineering` or `Community and Partnerships`) to align team members on a plan.

### Oversee work for projects and teams

- Assign work items to team members on a given project according to team priorities.
- Hold team members accountable for completing work on-time, or for adjusting scope as needed.

### Communicate progress and status to internal stakeholders

- Make our work transparent, discoverable, and understanding to internal stakeholders, especially those that communicate with _external_ stakeholders.
- Share information about the status and progress of major work items.
- Surface changes in scope or identified risk in accomplishing our goals.

## Team structure

Our operations team largely consists of **Project Managers** that oversee the coordination and execution of work on a given project.
They tend to **oversee backlogs** that a number of team members work on, and work with key stakeholders to **ensure that our teams execute their work** according to our priorities and objectives.

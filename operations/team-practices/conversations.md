# Guide for open, honest conversations

It is critical for 2i2c's team to feel comfortable being honest with one another, and engaging in conversations even if they are potentially challenging or controversial.
Doing so productively requires thoughtfulness and skill.
Here are some principles that can help.

## Assume positive intent
Engaging in conversations that challenge our worldviews can be difficult. It leads to defensive interactions because we feel like we are being attacked. This prevents us from understanding or hearing what is truly being communicated.

:::{admonition} Recommendation
Short-circuit the natural defensive posture and assume that the person with whom we are communicating is not “out to get us”. When we assume positive intent, it helps us to remain neutral, allowing us to be curious.
:::

## Create psychological safety
Without psychological safety, teams and individuals cease to have productive conversations. Mistrust takes root and crucial conversations become veiled in suspicion, bias and blame.

:::{admonition} Recommendation
Be mindful of what triggers you. Manage and maintain neutral body language. Use language that invites curiosity (e.g. Can you tell me more about this perspective…)
:::

## Seek to understand, not to be understood
When having conversations about important and controversial topics, it is easy for everyone to try to get their point across. What ends up happening however, is that we don’t stop to try to understand what is being communicated and so, the conversation devolves into everyone talking at each other and tensions flare.

:::{admonition} Recommendation
Make space to listen deeply to what the other person is communicating. Don’t listen just to respond and provide a rebuttal. Listen to understand. A great way to do this is to summarize back to the person what you have understood were there key points (e.g. My understanding of what you are saying is that 1…, 2… and 3…, Have I gotten it correctly?)

## Be honest (Do not avoid uncomfortable topics)
Which sharing honest feedback and critical information, don’t be a jerk. Just because you are speaking the truth doesn’t mean that your language has to be caustic and hurtful. Be mindful that you are speak with a human, even while maintaining the message even during emotional duress.

:::{admonition} Recommendation
Don’t sugar coat the message
Don’t do nice/nasty/nice sandwiches
If you believe that the recipient of the message is starting to experience emotional duress, pause and ask them if they’d like a minute to compose themselves or continue the conversation in a few minutes. Do not apologize for your message.
:::

## Welcome critical feedback
No body likes receiving critical information that exposes their failures/shortcomings/etc. However, these are exactly the types of information that can help us to grow and we shouldn’t avoid them, even when they may cause us some discomfort.

:::{admonition} Recommendation
Here are a few ways to help:

Ask peers for specific feedback in areas where you already know that you are weak
Ask peers for feedback in areas/activities/etc where they think you need to radically improve.
:::

## Focus on shared interests, not positions

Instead of disagreeing/challenge with the person, disagree/challenge with their position. Ultimately, we want to separate the person/personality from their position so that it’s the position that we are challenging.

:::{admonition} Recommendation
Regard the position that person is articulating and challenge that. (e.g [challenging the person] Harold, you are stupid this will never work vs [challenging the position] Harold, I disagree with your idea and feel it is ill conceived becasue…). The latter is not a personal attack. The former is more likely to be perceived as such.

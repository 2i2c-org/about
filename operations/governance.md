# Principles of decision making

:::{admonition} Work in progress!
This is a work in progress, and currently only has a lightweight decision-making process that we have followed thus far.
See https://github.com/2i2c-org/meta/issues/489 for discussion on adding more structure here.

## Strive for consensus, decide with consent

We strive for consensus across all of the areas of 2i2c, and discussions should focus on arriving at a plan that we are all excited about.
However, we recognize that this is often difficult in the face of complex and sometimes conflicting needs and plans.
If it is not clear that we will reach consensus, follow **a consent-based decision-making process**[^consent-decision-making].
Ensure that nobody has major objections rather than finding the perfect solution for everybody.
Don't block one another's proposals just because it is not perfect.

[^consent-decision-making]: Here are some helpful resources for more information about consent-based decision-making.

    - A short primer: https://thedecider.app/consent-decision-making
    - A more in-depth discussion: https://sociocracyforall.org/consent-decision-making/
    - A well-known technical proposal on "Consent via humming": https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7282

**On tie breakers**.
If there are still major objections to a proposal, but we must nonetheless take action, we should give somebody the authority to make a decision in order to move forward.
Who this person is depends on the decision that is being made.
If it's a decision within a team, then this is a **Team Lead**.
If it's a decision across the organization, then this is **the Executive Director**.
This should happen _rarely_, but it is crucial for moving forward.

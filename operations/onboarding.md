# Getting started and onboarding

This is a short guide for welcoming new team members to the 2i2c team.
Its goal is to give others an idea for where to look for information and how to familiarize themselves with our structure and processes.

:::{admonition} Don't try to learn all of this at once!
2i2c is a distributed organization, which means that we rely **heavily** on documentation.
Don't worry about figuring it all out immediately - this guide will try to focus on the most important parts to get started.

## The onboarding process

First off, here's the process we follow when onboarding new team members.

When a new team member joins, follow these two steps first:

1. **Identify an Onboarding Champion**. This is somebody that will help guide the onboarding process for our new team member.
   Their job is to carry out the process described in the onboarding issue template.
2. **Open an onboarding issue in the Team Compass**.
   This issue will track the onboarding process, and serves as the {term}`Source of Truth` for steps to take in order to onboard a new team member.

## Our documentation structure

Documentation is very important to 2i2c, because it is the way that we share information across our asynchronous and distributed team.
Anything worth sharing once is worth documenting for all.

Our documentation all uses the same set of tools, which all team members need to be familiar with.

See [our documentation guide](../reference/documentation/overview.md) for an overview of our documentation workflow and our major sources of documentation.


## How our team compass is organized

[Our team compass](https://compass.2i2c.org) is the source of truth for all of our practices.
It is roughly divided into three sections:

- **Organization-wide sections** cover information about 2i2c itself. They are generally managed by our {role}`Executive Director`.
- **Functional areas** focus on particular aspects of our operation, and are usually managed by a functional lead.
- **Managed JupyterHub Service** is a special section that has a lot of cross-area documentation focused around our hub service.
  It's in a dedicated section because it doesn't really belong in any one functional area.
- **Reference documentation** is a place to collect many pieces of information in one place, and for extra documentation that is useful across the organization.

Sections of our Team Compass should roughly follow the same high-level structure.
For example, most of our functional areas have a "Structure" section that describes their roles and team structure, as well as a "Workflow" section that describes their workings in more detail.


## Where to learn about our workflow

As a distributed team, we have a few practices that are geared towards keeping everybody on the same page given that we're in many different time zones.
Here are the right places to learn more about our workflow:

- [Our organization-wide section](../organization/index.md) has an overview of our mission, structure, and strategy.
- [Our team operations section](../operations/index.md) has an overview of our organization-wide practices and workflow.
- [Our types of meetings page](../operations/meetings.md) describes the kinds of meetings we have across 2i2c.
  Different teams each interpret these in a different way, but this covers the basics.

Beyond these, your workflow will likely depend on the functional area where you work.
For example, [the engineering team](../engineering/workflow.md) tends to work heavily on GitHub and uses many GitHub Issues tickets to track its work.

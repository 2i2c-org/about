# Onboard a team member

New 2i2c team members are onboarded in order to make sure that the following conditions are met:

- They know where to look for certain information
- They have access to all of the accounts and services we use
- They feel welcome and excited to be a part of the team
- They have an understanding of what 2i2c is currently up to
- They have enough information to get started

When a new team member joins, follow these two steps first:

1. **Identify an Onboarding Champion**. This is somebody that will help guide the onboarding process for our new team member.
   Their job is to carry out the process described in the onboarding issue template.
2. **Open an onboarding issue in the Team Compass**. 
   This issue will track the onboarding process, and serves as the {term}`Source of Truth` for steps to take in order to onboard a new team member.

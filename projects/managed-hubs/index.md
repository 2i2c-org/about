# Managed JupyterHub Service

The Managed JupyterHub Service is an ongoing service to **sustain and scale** a collaborative, community-driven, interactive computing service for communities in research and education.

**[`docs.2i2c.org`](https://docs.2i2c.org) has most of the information about this service**.

The sections here contain information that is more relevant to 2i2c team members (like support process documentation).

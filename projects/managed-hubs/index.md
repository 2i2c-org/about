# Managed JupyterHub Service

The Managed JupyterHub Service is a special project that is run by 2i2c.
It is an ongoing service, and thus is less development-oriented than projects that are funded by grants and collaborations.

The key goal of the 2i2c Managed JupyterHub Service is to launch a self-sustaining service that provides managed JupyterHub distributions to customers in research and education.

We are currently in the pilot phase of this project, with the goal of creating a basic shared infrastructure that can deploy, configure, and manage many JupyterHub distributions.
We are also building a sales and support pipeline around this infrasturcture.

## Where is information located?

**Infrastructure and development** happens in [the `infrastructure/` repository](https://github.com/2i2c-org/infrastructure).
This is both the deployment infrastructure for the 2i2c JupyterHubs, as well as documentation and team coordination around developing and running them.

**The Hub Engineer's Guide** describes how to develop and operate the 2i2c `infrastructure/` infrastructure.
It is generally designed for 2i2c engineers to follow and learn.
You can find it at [infrastructure.2i2c.org](https://infrastructure.2i2c.org).

**The Hub Administrator's Guide** provides for Hub Administrators to customize and control their hub.
It is community-facing, and meant as a more external view on the 2i2c Hubs Pilot.
It also describes high-level information about the pilot in general.
It is located at [pilot.2i2c.org](https://pilot.2i2c.org) (or [the `pilot/` repository](https://github.com/2i2c-org/pilot))

**Strategy and roadmaps** for the Managed Hubs Pilot are located in the Hub Administrator's guide. 

For other information about the Managed Hubs Pilot, see the sections below.

## A list of running JupyterHubs

We keep a table with all of our currently-running JupyterHubs at this location: [List of Running JupyterHubs](https://infrastructure.2i2c.org/en/latest/reference/hubs.html).

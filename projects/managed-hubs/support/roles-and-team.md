# Roles and team structure

Supporting a 2i2c hub is a collaborative process between 2i2c and the community we serve.

The **Support Team** is one of the main teams in our **Managed JupyterHub Service Team**.

This consists of three main roles: {term}`Support Triagers`, {term}`Community Representatives`, and {term}`Hub Administrators`.

```{glossary}
Support Triager
Support Triagers
  A **two-person team** of {term}`Support Triagers` work together to triage and communicate with all external support requests.
  Tenure on the support team is **for four weeks**.
  Every **two weeks** (generally at the sprint meeting), a Support Triager cycles off the support team, and a new team member joins the team.
  The support team rotates through [the “Open Infrastructure Engineering Team”](https://compass.2i2c.org/reference/team/), in alphabetical order.

  The primary responsibilities of the Support Triagers are:

  - Ensure that we meet {external+docs:ref}`our Support Service Level Objectives <objectives:support>`.
  - Carry out [our support process](support:process).
  - Act as primary points of contact with {term}`Community Representative`s.
  - Trigger an [Incident Response](support:incident-response) if need be.

  Common alternate terms: **Customer Liason**, **External Liason**, or **Customer Support**.

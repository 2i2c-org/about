We are currently working out our support process.
The content on this page might change over time, and we welcome suggested changes and pull requests!

This section contains information that our team uses to triage, communicate, and
resolve {term}`Support Requests` that come from communities.

Currently, Engineering has the authority to design the system of roles and
processes that defines "support at 2i2c", and to advocate for the resources
needed to fill those roles. This will naturally be done in collaboration with
others in 2i2c, but Engineering leads the effort and has an outsized role in the
decision-making.

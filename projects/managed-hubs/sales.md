## Sending invoices

For our monthly hub service, once we have an active contract with a community, CS&S will begin sending them monthly invoices according to the contract that we have with them.

See [our Invoices AirTable](contracts:invoices) for a list of all invoices that CS&S has sent.

See [our Contracts AirTable](conracts:active) for a list of all of our contracts.

### When to decide to work with a lead

To decide whether we should continue engaging with a particular lead, we need to know whether they are in-scope for our mission and likely to be able to successfully collaborate with us.
The [`MANIAC-T` framework](https://xxiibrands.com/sales/qualify-your-sales-leads-with-maniac-t/) can be helpful in coming to a decision. Here is a short description of these guideilnes:

* **Money**. Is there a specific amount of money set aside for the project? If they are seeking funding in order to pay for this, what are the details?
* **Authority**. Does the contact have the authority to make a buying decision? Who else will need to be involved in the decision-making process?
* **Need**. What are their clear pain-points with their current infrastructure setup? Do they seem to have a real need for change?
* **Impending Event**. Do they have an upcoming event that is urgent or pressing?
* **Application**. Is their use-case a good fit for 2i2c infrastructure? Would their use-case require major changes to our hubs? Is there a different organization better-suited to help them?
* **Competition**. What alternative options are they considering? e.g., other organizations, internal approaches, or deciding to do nothing?
* **Timeline**. What does the buying process look like for this prospect? E.g., finalizing a contract, or receiving a sub-award.

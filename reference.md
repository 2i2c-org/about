For-profit companies with interesting histories that we should avoid becoming.

- [Wikia / Fandom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fandom_(website)), similar to the Wikimedia Foundation but a for-profit company offering wiki hosting that is ad supported / paid.
- [Reddit](https://github.com/reddit-archive/reddit) used to be open source code / infrastructure! At some point post aquisition by Conde Nast that all stopped. So with wikimedia & reddit being both open source, at some point 2 of the top 10 websites in the world were run like this.
- [Discourse](https://www.discourse.org/) - offers an open source hosted community forum application. They do a good job of walking the line between community values and sustainability (e.g., see [the discourse about page](https://www.discourse.org/about)
- [OpenAI](https://openai.com/blog/openai-api/) is a company that builds products and development around AI. It is [governed by a non-profit](https://openai.com/about).
- [Ithaka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ithaka_Harbors) is a non-profit organizations that provides scholarly services for the academic community.
- [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/) is a large open-core company that is innovative in its remote- and async-friendly organization as well as its transparency.

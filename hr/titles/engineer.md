# Open Source Infrastructure Engineer

The Open Source Infrastructure (OSIE) focuses on infrastructure that supports interactive computing. It intersects job titles such as “dev-ops engineer”, “site reliability engineer”, “software engineer”, and “cloud engineer”. This person should have experience with cloud infrastructure. They generally both operate 2i2c Hubs, as well as  develop technology for them. In general, a _minority_ of time should be spend operating hubs - we want to use operations as an opportunity to drive development and minimize human-in-the-loop maintenance.

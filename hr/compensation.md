# Compensation and Benefits

## Compensation philosophy

See [the 2i2c Careers page](https://2i2c.org/careers/) for a short description of our compensation philosophy.

Salaries at 2i2c are determined solely by job title as well as several steps within that job (corresponding to experience in a particular job).
We have [internal salary documents for the specific positions and levels](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FJM5pAbc0EWhu4CpPjlbWTMOsZAnivEd2ZBIZIdwpE8/edit?usp=sharing).

## Benefits

Benefits are offered by {term}`Code for Science and Society`.
They are offered via [TriNet](https://www.trinet.com/) as described in [the CS&S employee handbook](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1anHo8P09gjGLnUfGj2ceSDxvJTYwMeS1/view?usp=sharing).

# Compensation and Benefits

## Compensation philosophy

See [the 2i2c Careers page](https://2i2c.org/careers/) for a short description of our compensation philosophy.

Salaries at 2i2c are determined solely by job title as well as several steps within that job (corresponding to experience in a particular job).
We have [internal salary documents for the specific positions and levels](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FJM5pAbc0EWhu4CpPjlbWTMOsZAnivEd2ZBIZIdwpE8/edit?usp=sharing).

### GuideStar compensation comparisons

We define our salary levels relative to non-profit organizations with a similar size and scope as 2i2c.
In order to have a more objective definition of competitive salaries, we use [the GuideStar compensation report](https://www.guidestar.org/) to compare common numbers across non-profits.
This is provided by CS&S, and we have a PDF in our drive here:

- [GuideStar Report for non-profits similar to us(2020)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qb6qSTBqvrgQeTywjHfMlAqhUDau-x31/view?usp=sharing) - - [Full report here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1i6cO-FjwN0nZfTfBUf7Vd9hdVILNeCQw/view?usp=sharing)

We generally use the following criteria when defining the salary for a given position / level with the GuideStar report:

- Use the “Science and Technology Research Institutes, Services” category
- Use the $1m-$5m budget category
- Choose an appropriate job category that most closely matches this position.
- Define “compensation” as base salary + 30% benefits
- Aim for the median compensation in a category 
- The numbers there are for the **top-paid position**  
  - Reduce accordingly depending on the level we're hiring for. A good rule of thumb for defining new roles is to expect a 10% salary bump between levels, and a 2% salary bump for steps within a level.

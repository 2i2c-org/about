# Job Titles

This document represents the positions and salary levels that 2i2c uses. They are inspired by the hiring/salary structure of several tech companies[^job-refs].

## Terminology and structure

Each position at 2i2c takes the following form:

```
<role-name> L<level>
```

For example, **Open Source Infrastructure Engineer L2**.

Here is a quick breakdown of this terminology and structure:

Role
: Positions are specific areas of focus and skills in 2i2c. The expectations and focus-areas within that role are set by Levels and Steps.

Levels
: Levels are large and distinct jumps in terms of area knowledge, role complexity and overall scope. Higher levels generally mean less-oversight and more autonomy, higher expectations of quality, more work on design / strategy than implementation, etc.

Moreover, each role should have a few key pieces of information:

Key goal
: A one- or two-sentence description of the primary goal of this role. It is the one thing that should be done well, and will be the main definition of "success".

Responsibilities and Expectations
: The major things that this person is expected to do or oversee, what kinds of expectations we have for how they'll do their work, and what their relationship should be to others within 2i2c.

Performance measures
: Quantitative or qualitative metrics that are useful in measuring the success of people in this role. Our goal is to be precise about the kind of impact that this role should have in 2i2c.

We are still building out these materials and role definitions, so this structure may evolve, and some roles may be missing information.

## Open Source Infrastructure Engineer

The Open Source Infrastructure (OSIE) focuses on infrastructure that supports interactive computing. It intersects job titles such as “dev-ops engineer”, “site reliability engineer”, “software engineer”, and “cloud engineer”. This person should have experience with cloud infrastructure. They generally both operate 2i2c Hubs, as well as  develop technology for them. In general, a _minority_ of time should be spend operating hubs - we want to use operations as an opportunity to drive development and minimize human-in-the-loop maintenance.

## Senior Open Source Infrastructure Engineer

The Senior Open Source Infrastructure Engineer (SOSIE) role is designed to help guide our team and cultivate a healthy and productive culture.
It is heavily inspired by [On being a senior engineer](https://www.kitchensoap.com/2012/10/25/on-being-a-senior-engineer/).

This role focuses their efforts on our infrastructure, but spends a lot of their time guiding others, focusing on particularly complex infrastructure design and development, and interfacing with other teams and stakeholder communities to help guide our development. Below is a short list of expectations for this role.

- Solve complex technical problems with **broad, cross-project scope**, often
  involving co-ordination with multiple teams across different open source
  projects.

- Acts as a point of escalation for complex technical problems, preferring to
  solve them with collaborative guidance rather than 'just doing it'.

- Coordinate with product/business teams on roadmap priorities, and provide
  implementation suggestions and effort estimates.

- Provide guidance on major strategic questions in infrastructure and
  engineering team strategy

- Helps grow other engineers via mentorship, code & design review, and
  sponsorship to find opportunities for them

- Act as a role model for positive, inclusive, and constructive team dynamics.

## Partnerships Lead

:::{note}
We are currently experimenting with this role, and will evolve these goals, responsibilities, etc as we learn more.
We should revisit this section in September 2022.

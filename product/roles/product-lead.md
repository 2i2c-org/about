As a starting point to describe this role, below we provide the text we used in the job posting.
```

The Product Lead is a senior-level role that will be instrumental in shaping 2i2c’s product vision, strategy, and execution of our "product function" within the team. You'll own the product vision, align it with user needs, and translate it into a clear product roadmap which defines cross-functional priorities and guides our partnerships and engineering teams, enabling efficient product delivery and continuous improvement.

You’ll have a good level of technical understanding and be genuinely interested in the 2i2c offering, ideally having worked previously with platform teams and/or worked at a very detailed level alongside engineers and/or were a software Engineer yourself. In addition, recent experience in, or a good understanding of, [Product Operations](https://blog.logrocket.com/product-management/product-operations/) would be essential to your success in this role. 

## What you'll do

The Product Lead would work with others, in particular the Delivery Manager and the Engineering Manager, to design a process to measure and track the flow of work through the team. You’ll shape the future of our product by gathering and distilling ideas from the collective group, fostering a shared vision. Working collaboratively, you’ll drive the development of our product and effectively position the product as a key function within our organization.

On a day to day basis you’ll:

- Define and own the product vision and strategy assuming ‘the voice of the user’, and doing so collaboratively and inclusively with our team and key stakeholders.
- Create a clear product roadmap that guides the engineering and partnerships teams and ensures alignment with the organizational vision.
- Collaborate closely with our engineers and users in partner organizations (researchers, educators etc.) to translate the product roadmap into actionable plans and tasks, managing a structured product backlog and sign-off of completed deliverables.
- Prioritize the product backlog based on impact, feasibility, and partner needs, ensuring alignment with the product roadmap.
- Define and manage a system to integrate and prioritize reactive tasks and contributions from the JupyterHub open-source community, which will in some instances shape the product direction in real-time.
- Working collaboratively with users to understand their news, gathering feedback and insights that shape the product vision and roadmap. 
- Elicit insights and incorporate the deep experience from the Engineering team into the product vision and roadmap. 
- Measure and enhance efficiency, quality, and flow within the product development lifecycle, incorporating ProductOps principles.
- Optimize processes to ensure a smooth and streamlined flow of work, promoting a structured and efficient product delivery approach.

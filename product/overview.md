# Scope and responsibilities

Product describes the services and technology that 2i2c provides, the value they are meant to provide, and the stakeholders and user archetypes that are meant for.

Currently, there is no dedicated product function within 2i2c, so this section is a place to collect broad product-related information and strategy.

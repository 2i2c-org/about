# Product prioritization workflow

As of February 2024, 2i2c adopted Productboard as a tool to help manage product prioritization and collect insights relevant to our product improvement process. Productboard helps us list, detail and prioritize all of the insights and ideas that feed into the improvement of our products and services, in turn helping us ensure that we spend our time and resources solving the right problems for our communities.

For those unfamiliar with Productboard, we have put together a short [primer](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UkFcv2klEBOEnZ4CoB7PnVYS6MNOn5fCfM7unbco2lI/edit?usp=sharing) covering its basics, to help yowu navigate and contribute your input into the Product Delivery Flow.

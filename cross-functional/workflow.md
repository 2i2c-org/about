## Meeting for organizational strategy

We have a bi-weekly **Organization and strategy meeting** to discuss and refine major priorities across the organization.
See [our running notes for more information](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1HoNX8T8IQ1uhS2ryi1r9iS-nSbPT1b1Y7HsjosbHme8&authuser=1&usp=meetingnotes&showmeetingnotespromo=true).

## Strategic priorities board

We have a special project board to track the priorities of each functional area.
We update this roughly every quarter.

## Organization-wide backlog

We have a backlog to track organization-wide work items.
These are generally championed by one of our leads, or by the executive director.

We also track [our strategic objectives](strategy:objectives) in this board.

## The `#team-updates` Slack channel

The [`#team-updates` Slack channel](https://2i2c.slack.com/archives/C01GLCC1VCN) is for organization-wide announcements and team discussion.
It is a place for the whole organization to talk to one another, share status and life updates, etc.
There's not a strict limit to topics for discussion, but if your conversation fits within the scope of another Slack channel it's better to discuss there.

## The `#solution-forum` Slack channel

The [`#solution-forum` Slack channel](https://2i2c.slack.com/archives/C06G5FAAT63) is a space for cross-organization initiatives and strategic conversation.

- It is meant for discussing organization-wide practices, policies, and planning.
- It will have a combination of strategic- and tactical-level discussion. (in the future we may split this into two channels if it's too much)
- It will initially focus its discussion around our "cross-functional initiatives" board and the items in it.
- Anyone that participates in conversations in this channel should dedicate the attention to understand the context for discussion and participate until topics are resolved.
- Area leads are expected to monitor this channel and participate in cross-team conversations as they arise.
- All 2i2c staff have visibility into the channel and may participate in conversations, but are not expected to do so as part of their daily responsibilities.

# Intellectual property

This page describes our approach to intellectual property with any assets we interact with regarding open source code, text, images, and upstream communities.[^1]

[^1]: See [the CS&S briefing on Intellectual Property](https://www.codeforsociety.org/resources/intellectual-property-in-open-projects) for an overview of some considerations here.

## Software licenses

### In 2i2c repositories

Our fiscal sponsor holds the rights to any code that is generated in the 2i2c repository ([`@2i2c-org`](https://github.com/2i2c-org)).

Any code that we control should be released under an [OSI approved license](https://opensource.org/licenses) with permissive restrictions.
For example, the [Apache License 2.0](https://opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0) or the [BSD-3 Clause "New" or "Revised"](https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause) license. By default, we use [the BSD 3-Clause license](https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause).

### In upstream repositories

Upstream communities own the right to any code or text that is contributed to a repository in an upstream organization (e.g., [`@jupyterhub`](https://github.com/jupyterhub)).
2i2c gives up its right to this code - it is stewarded by the legal entity that owns the upstream repository.[^nf]
These communities dictate the license that these contributions are released under (generally speaking, it is a permissive license like [the BSD 3-Clause license](https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause))

[^nf]: In Jupyter's case, this is the fiscal sponsor [NumFocus](https://numfocus.org).

## Text and non-trademark design assets

Our fiscal sponsor holds the rights to any written assets and non-trademark design assets (e.g. diagrams made for blog posts).

We release them under [the Creative Commons BY 4.0 (CC-BY 4.0) license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
In some cases we may share material with a [Share Alike clause (CC-BY SA)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/) but generally do not release material with an [Non-commercial (NC)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/) or [No Derivatives (ND)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/2.0/) license.

## Trademarks and logos

Our fiscal sponsor holds the rights to any trademarks or logos that are created as part of a 2i2c effort.
We do not license these for re-use.

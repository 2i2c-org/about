## Salary rationale

The most similar positions in the GuideStar report for this role are:

- Top Programs Position
- Top Development Position

However, there is relatively little data for this position at the budget size of 2i2c.
If we look one budget-level higher in the GuideStar report, it appears that the Development Position and the Programs Position are comparable in salary.
For that reason, we'll use the `Top Programs Position` as the reference position for the base salary of this title.

Comparable titles:

- Sustainability Lead
- Business Affairs Director
- Business Development Director

# Hiring process and information

This page contains information about the hiring process at 2i2c.
It is meant to be a helpful guide and resources to streamline hiring in the future[^references].

## Overview of hiring process

Below is a brief overview of the process we must follow any time we wish to make a new job posting.
A complete guide to our hiring process is defined [in this Hiring Process Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12OGWrjBXRQwfGuR1lE-uxJLsCKrKu5yvm3xNibndJTA/edit#).

1. **Define a {term}`Hiring Lead`** for this hire.
2. **Find, refine, or write an internal job description** in the Team Compass.
3. **Create a hiring folder in our Hiring Shared Drive**. This needs to be done by the Executive Director.
4. **Write a public job description** using the Job Description template in [our Templates Folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1J6b1d-Kzkmhfb7VupptfpP19rt9Fmj0u?usp=sharing).
5. **Send the job description to `fsp@codeforsociety.org`** and get approval.
6. **Create a {term}`Hiring Committee`** and add them to materials.
8.  **Create a hiring portal** where applicants apply.
9.  **Post the job** and wait for responses.
10. **Triage all applicants** and narrow down to 4-8 we wish to learn more about.
11. **Screen** 4-8 applicants with a 30 minute phone call.
12. **Interview** 1-3 applicants in a 90 minute interview.
13. **Discuss and rank** candidates.
14. **Make an offer**.
15. **Clean up**
16. Once accepted, **move the hiring folder to `Archive`**.

## Hiring team

The hiring team carries out the hiring process.
It is a transient team that is put together for the purpose of hiring a new team member, and is usually a collection of team members across other parts of 2i2c.

There are two roles in the hiring team:

```{glossary}
Hiring Lead
  The Hiring Lead oversees the hiring process for a candidate.
  They are usually:

  - The direct supervisor of the person to be hired
  - Experienced with the goals and needs of this hire.
  - Experienced with the skills and qualities needed for the job
  - Familiar with hiring processes in general (at 2i2c or elsewhere)

Hiring Committee
Hiring Team Members
  Individuals that help out with various parts of the hiring process.
  We aim to spread the load of serving on hiring committees across team members, and try to have committee members for individuals that will work closely with the new hire.
```

## Where to find information

We have a few resources to help with hiring, see below:

- Our [Hiring Project Board](https://github.com/orgs/2i2c-org/projects/37) tracks all current and past hires, with links to relevant information.
- A shared team drive called `2i2c Hiring` stores the information we collect during candidate searches.
  - [The **Active** folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1XGkoF1oyBfP1T_NiAX0tHkf2HxIqA84O?usp=share_link) contains active hires.
  - [The **Archive** folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1eu8c2GpGnvUF0TuukdDhxoyMxj4au2sQ?usp=share_link) has past hires.
- [The Hiring Templates folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1J6b1d-Kzkmhfb7VupptfpP19rt9Fmj0u?usp=sharing) has several template files that can help you structure and carry out a candidate search.
  - [The Hiring Process Outline](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12OGWrjBXRQwfGuR1lE-uxJLsCKrKu5yvm3xNibndJTA/edit?usp=share_link) should be copied and used to track progress for the new hire.

# Hiring process and information

This page contains information about the hiring process at 2i2c.
It is meant to be a helpful guide and resources to streamline hiring in the future.

## Define a Hiring Lead and Team

The hiring team is a transient team that is put together for the purpose of hiring a new team member.
Here are its major roles:

```{glossary}
Hiring Lead
  The Hiring Lead oversees the hiring process for a candidate.
  They are usually the direct supervisor of the person to be hired.

Hiring Committee
Hiring Team
Hiring Team Members
  Individuals that help out with various parts of the hiring process.
  We aim to spread the load of serving on hiring committees across team members, and try to have committee members for individuals that will work closely with the new hire.
```

## Make a formal job offer for CS&S

Once we've reached informal agreement with a candidate, [make a copy of this information gathering document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TYqm85Z2kovDSwcGlzGCeqa1NHtRi4Mcpg3JGjAYhTs/edit?usp=sharing) and follow the instructions.

## Targeted hiring process

Sometimes, we detect an outstanding person that we might want to hire without a public process.
In this case, form a {term}`Hiring Team` and fill in the Targeted hiring sections of the [Formal job offer template](hiring:offer-template).
